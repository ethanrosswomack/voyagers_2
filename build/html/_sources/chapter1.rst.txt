As each vortex progressively opens and activates, the dimensional frequency
bands that correspond to the vortex number begin transmitting through Earth's
morphogenetic field. This causes the Sphere of Amenti to begin transmitting its
morphogenetic imprint for that dimensional frequency band through Earth's grid. The
frequency imprints for DNA strands 1 - 8, which are stored within the morphogenetic
field of the Sphere of Amenti (along with the imprints for strands 9-12), progressively
transmit through Earth's grid, as the dimensional frequency bands that correspond to
each strand begin transmission . The frequency bands of D-8 Meta-galactic Core, which
accelerate activation of the 8th DNA strand, transmit through Earth's grid when Earth's planetary
core comes into a direct 3-day alignment with the cores of Tara, Gaia and the Meta-galactic
Core, as Earth aligns directly with the Holographic Beam. The imprints for DNA strands 9-12 do
not transmit through Earth's grid; they are accessible only through the grid of Tara. Activation of
strands 1-8 on Earth allows for ascension to the Taran time cycles, from which the imprint for
strands 9-12 can be accessed.
  The human bio-energetic field picks up the DNA imprint through its direct contact
with the bio-energetic fields of Earth's grid, which provides humans with the opportunity
to add that imprint in its operational DNA construction. The process of activating the new
imprint takes place as the strand imprint is pulled from the bio-energetic field, into the
personal morphogenetic field, at which point the new imprint will begin manifestation
within the operational DNA strands . DNA strand mutations are purged from the race
morphogenetic imprint in the Sphere of Amenti and the strand imprint is realigned with the
12 strand DNA pattern by the successive births of the 6 Silent Ascension Avatars.
Transmission of the corrected DNA strand imprints through Earth’s grid allows a
reverse-mutation of various ascension-inhibiting human genetic distortions to take place .
Earth's 7 Primary Vortices  open only during the two ascension cycles, at the beginning and
end of a 26,556-year Harmonic Universe Euiago time cycle, The energetic dynamics that Earth
now approaches, as it enters the ½ cycle point in its 2nd ascension cycle, are unprecedented
within the annals of recorded human history . The coming of these events has been symbolically
foretold through oral and written tradition for thousands of years.

T = birth is scheduled for this date, but may occur any time earlier, most likely
following the birth of the previous avatar. Birth must occur no later than
scheduled date. Birth will remain as scheduled  unless circumstances warrant
change. ** = avatar 3 was not scheduled to birth until 2000 AD, but Elohim
arranged the birth 2 years early to open the 2nd seal on the Arc of the Covenant,
so the ascension schedule could remain on course. NOTE:  There will also be
144,000 + ''indigo Children " born between 1999 - 2017  They will carry the 6
DNA strand Paradisian Race Imprint , that of the fully embodied HU-2 soul essence.
They represent  D-6 soul essence  and will birth via the frequencies of the D-6 Sirian
Spiral , which falls within the inter-dimensional lndigo light wave spectrum , thus
their name. Activation of the 6th DNA strand of a minimum of 144,000 individuals is
essential for Earth's passage into the Bridge Zone. The D-6 souls will birth on Earth
to serve in ful filling this requirement. The 6 Silent Avatars and indigo Children are born
via Palaidorian Birthing Contracts  and Contract Bonds.

                                          Origins - Secrets of Amenti
                                            At-A-Glance Blow-Up Chart
Human Origins : Humanity began 560 million years ago, as an Immortal Race called
the Turaneusiam on planet Tara in Harmonic Universe-2 (HU-2). The Turaneusiam race
had a 12 strand DNA morphogenetic imprint that allowed for embodiment of the 12 dimensional
frequency bands of an HU-4 avatar identity. Humans were created as a planetary guardian race
of God-like beings.
Lost Souls of Tara:  Through a Turaneusiam created cataclysm on HU-2 Tara 550 million
years ago part of Tara's grid fragmented into HU-1 through the core of the 8th Pleiadian star,
forming 12 planets that became Earth's solar system. Many of the Immortal Souls of Tara were
fragmented into HU-1 with the lost portions of Tara; they became known as the Lost Souls of
Tara or the Fallen Angels. The Palaidorian and Ur-Tarranate races of Tara created a project
through which the lost souls of Tara could re-evolve into their original 12 strand DNA immortal
imprint and be freed from HU-1.
The Sphere of Amenti  race morphogenetic field was created to give the soul fragments of Tara
that were lost in the Earth's dimensional fields the pattern of the 12 strand DNA imprint, through
which they could re-evolve into their original Turaneusiam form. The Sphere of Amenti served as 
a Host Matrix (surrogate morphogenetic field or "form-holding blueprint") through which the
Lost Souls of Tara could evolve and return home. The Amenti rescue mission represents a Host Soul 
Matrix Transplant on the species level. All present Earthly strains of human have evolved through the 
morphogenetic imprint of the Sphere of Amenti.
Seeding the 12 Tribes of Amenti:  Through the Sphere of Amenti race morphogenetic field 7 Root  
Races and 5 Cloister Races  were created, through which the 12 strand DNA imprint could be 
rooted into Earth biology to evolve. The first 2 Root races were etheric in nature and evolved on
HU-3 D-7 Gaia, setting the pattern of the 1st DNA strand into Earth's planetary morphogenetic field.
The remaining 5 Root Races & 5 Cloister Races were to be seeded on Earth & Tara during
different time periods. Each Root Race would assemble and evolve 1 DNA strand imprint from Amenti
into Earth's biological gene pool. The Cloister Race appearing with each Root Race would evolve the 
imprints for strands 7-12 as dormant gene codes along with the imprint for the strand carried by their
Root Race. The Cloister Races allowed the strands of cellular transmutation to remain alive within the 
biological gene pool.
The 3 Seedings:  The Amenti Rescue Mission failed twice due to Interstellar Wars over humanity's 
right to evolve on Earth. The Palaidorians, Ur-Tarranates & other guardian races of Tara, HU-2 
and HU-3 had to re-seed all but the first and second Root and Cloister Races 3 different times. The
present human lineage is part of the 3rd Seeding. Present day humans are primarily of the 5th Root 
Race Aryan  and Hibiru  Cloister Race strains. Some members of the 6th Cloister Race, the 
Melchizedeks , are also present on Earth and 150,000 7th Race Paradisian  souls, the 
Indigo Children , will be incarnating on Earth between 1999 - 2017 to accelerate the genetic 
evolution of the races and to help Earth shift to the Bridge Zone time continuum.
The Arc of the Covenant  is a time portal passage between Earth and the Andromeda galaxy
that was created 840,000 years ago by guardian races. I was used to store and protect the
Sphere of Amenti until the Sphere could be returned to Earth's core. The Arc allowed the Sphere
of Amenti to descend from Andromeda when Earth's core reached a high enough vibration rate.
Races of the 3rd Seeding were birthed into ﬂesh through the Arc of the Covenant. Arc was originally 
called the Arch of the Covenant of Palaidor, denoting the Palaidorian Covenant through which the 
Amenti Rescue Mission was begun 550 million years ago.

                                                  THE SIX SILENT ASCENSION A V ATARS
      During the ascension cycle of 2017 AD six avatar souls will incarnate on
Earth in order to serve various roles within the plan of human ascension and
evolution. An avatar soul is a soul essence possessing a minimum level of
over-soul consciousness, fully embodied within the physical incarnation; it is
a master-soul that incarnates from a position within Harmonic Universe 3 or
4. An avatar will have a minimum of 7-dimensional frequency bands within
its genetic imprint, and a minimum of seventh DNA strand activation at
birth. The human genetic prototype can hold only 12-dimensional frequency
bands within its imprint, a 12-strand DNA code. Avatars will thus have
between 7 and 12 DNA strands activated in their genetic code. (The last
12th-level avatar to incarnate on Earth was Jesheua-12, AKA  Jesus Christ/
Sananda - 12BC - 27 AD). The six Silent Ascension Avatars assisting in the
2017 ascension cycle will be born approximately four years apart beginning in
1992, the last being born in 2012. Though there will be several other avatar
souls incarnating on Earth during this period, the six Silent Ascension Ava-
tars hold a very special purpose of realigning the DNA imprint for the human
race within the morphogenetic field of the Sphere of Amenti.  
       As their respective soul essences pass through the Sphere of Amenti, the
frequency bands carried in their energetic essence will purge mutations from
the human DNA imprint, allowing DNA strands 2-7 to realign with the orig-
inal 12-strand DNA pattern of the HU-2 Turaneusiam-human prototype.
Without the birth of these avatars mutations within the human DNA code
would prevent humans from properly assembling and activating the DNA
strands and humanity would be unable to achieve acceleration of evolution
and ascension to the Bridge Zone, Tara or beyond. Each avatar is assigned to
the realignment of one DNA strand, which will be achieved as the soul
essence passes through the Sphere of Amenti during fetal integration.  
       When the avatars turn 12 years of age they will begin awakening to their
chosen service mission on Earth and by age 22, if their awakening proceeds
properly, they are scheduled to begin active service to further the evolution-
ary development of humans within the Bridge Zone Earth. The success of the
ascension program is dependent upon the births of the six Silent Ascension
Avatars proceeding according to schedule. They are called the Silent Avatars
because their identities, religious affiliations and geographical locations will
be undisclosed to the public during the ascension period. Their identities will
not be revealed until they have reached the age of 33 and their service mis-
sions come into mass awareness.

                             THE THREE TRACKS OF TIME  
Earth’s populations will permanently divide into three separate groups
2012-2017  
                 Time Track 1—Voyager Ascension—Tara D-4 Time Cycle  
Time-traveling V oyagers - 5532.5-year Leap into the Future (Tara AD  
7549.5)  
   •   Humans who are able to assemble and activate a minimum of the fifth
DNA strand will have the opportunity to transmute the body structure into
light & teleport through the portal passages of the Halls of Amenti to arrive
on planet Tara. Tara is Earth in the future space-time coordinates of the Har-
monic Universe-2 time cycles. Transfer to Tara represents a 5532.5-year time-
travel journey into the future. Humans teleporting/time-traveling to Tara are
called V oyagers.  
   •   V oyagers will experience subtle or direct contact by other V oyagers, ET
or metaterrestrial guardian groups prior to the ascension period, through
which they will receive training & make travel arrangements. V oyagers must
complete a minimum of two Stellar Activations to biologically tolerate trans-
port to Tara. V oyagers who are near 5 DNA strand assembly but assembly is
not quite complete cannot pass through Amenti directly. They will be pri-
vately escorted to guardian Transport landing sites & will travel to Tara via
interdimensional spacecraft.  
     •   Once arriving on Tara V oyagers will be given lodging & will attend ori-
entation classes to assist them with integration into Taran society as time-
travelers from the past. Taran culture is built upon the Law of One & is quite
Heavenly compared to Earthly existence.  
   •   V oyagers will find themselves in less-dense, more perfected versions of
their present bodies, free from disease, the necessity of death and the cycles of
reincarnation in HU-1.  
    •   Humans who have assembled the fifth DNA strand, but whose physical
bodies are beyond repair & will not permit the strand to activate, will physi-
cally die in usual terms then pass through the Halls of Amenti as conscious-
ness, to incarnate into an immortal body through a Taran parent couple.  
     •   In some cases couples or groups will be able to ascend together & will
be able to remain together on Tara if they choose to do so.  
   •   Full memory of multidimensional experience will return to the V oyag-
ers & they will have open relationships with ET and metaterrestrial commu-
nities while evolving on Tara.  
    • Few will take the path of the V oyager, but it is the path of choice & the
opportunity of many life times for those who can qualify.

   Time Track 2—Phantom Earth Descending Planet—D-3 Time Cycle  
                  Descending Humans — Return to the Present (Earth AD 2017)  
        • Humans who do not assemble all of the fourth and _ of the fifth DNA
strands will remain within the D-3 time cycle when Earth completes the
ascension period in 2017 and will follow the path of the Phantom Earth
Descending planet. If the Dracos-Zeta Resistance is successful in orchestrat-
ing the Frequency Fence in 2004, these populations will fall under covert
Dracos-Zeta bio-neurological mind control.  
        • Major Earth changes will occur on the Phantom Earth, due to the Fre-
quency Fence and Descending Humans will face disruptions in existing social
structure &  in filtration of the Dracos-Zeta hybrids.  
         • If the Frequency Fence is stopped, Descending Humans will face Earth
changes to a lesser degree and retain their existing level of freedom of choice,
but will become bio-energetically severed from their higher-dimensional
identity, Soul Matrix and evolutionary blueprint. This separation from the
Soul Matrix will cause a genetic mutation through which only the third
DNA strand can assemble. Over several generations this mutation will cause
break down of the genetic code and the inability to reproduce.  
         • Descending Humans will no longer be able to access multidimensional
awareness and will be unable to ascend out of HU-1 after death or reincar-
nate without a Host Matrix Transplant. Without an energetic link to a Soul
Matrix the consciousness becomes finite and will eventually fragment into
the Uni fied Field of HU-1 as undifferentiated units of consciousness.  
      • Experientially , Descending Humans will face some degree of Earth
changes, an acceleration of disease & deterioration during the ascension
period and will find that portions of Earth’s populations have literally van-
ished without a trace following 2017.  
        • Earth’ s primary particle base and morphogenetic field will transfer to
the Bridge Zone, D-3 Earth will represent the Phantom particle base left over
from Earth's transition & will become a Descending Planet, unable to evolve
out of the HU-1 time cycles.  
        • This is the least favorable path, with far reaching evolutionary conse-
quences, but will be experienced by large numbers of the population if they
do not rapidly awaken & take responsibility for conscious evolution.

                                           Bridge Zone Earth—Agartha—D-3.5 Time Cycle     
            Bridging Humans – Earth’ s 2213-year Leap into the Future (Agartha AD 5336.5)  
          
        • Humans who achieve assembly & activation of all of the fourth & _ of
the fifth DNA strand & who complete a minimum of 1.5 Stellar Activations
will be able to pass into the Bridge Zone-Agartha time continuum with Earth
in 2017. The primary 3-dimensional particle base of Earth, Earth’s core mor-
phogenetic field & the Sphere of Amenti race morphogenetic field will make
this transition. Some localized Earth changes may occur in regions of grid
instability as Earth transitions to the Bridge Zone. Transfer to the Bridge
Zone represents a planetary acceleration of time, through which Earth will
shift to a space-time location 2213-years in the future, from its present space-
time station.  
         • Bridging Humans will perceive a progressively more distinct separation
of those following the old paradigm & the new as 2012 approaches & popula-
tions begin to group by higher & lower particle pulsation rhythms. These
groups will literally “fall out of each other’s range of perception” by 2017. Peo-
ple of the new paradigm will progressively experience more rapid expansion
of consciousness & multidimensional perception, as a natural part of the
Stellar Activations they will encounter.  
    • Bridging Humans will experience more noticeable change than
Descending Humans will as Earth completes the 2017 transition. During the
3-day particle conversion period of 2017 they will find that many structures
that are composed of lower vibrating, inorganic substances & Descending
populations, will literally vanish or de-manifest. The most apparent change
will be in the sudden appearance of buildings & other structures of civiliza-
tion that were not there before, as portions of Agartha become visible. lt will
seem as if these structures “had always been there but had been forgotten”.
This will cause a bit of temporary space-time & memory disorientation for
Bridging Humans as their neurological structures adjust to the new electro-
magnetic pulsation rhythms of the Bridge Zone.  
    •Bridging Humans will have the opportunity to become V oyagers
through the natural acceleration of DNA assembly that will occur as a result
of Bridge Zone Earth's Stellar Activations.  
        • Those who do not V oyage will evolve within a more enlightened Earth
culture, in which new forms of free energy & Keylontic science applications
are discovered.  
       • Perceptually , Bridging Humans will experience a sense of less weight
within the atmosphere & their physical bodies & the body will have a
renewed sense of energy, health & vitality. As the higher chakra centers acti-
vate conscious integration of the soul identity will accelerate.     
449        
                                                                                                                                                                                                              

Data Summaries and At-A-Glance Blow-Up Charts
     •   During the 3-day period populations of Bridge Zone Earth may experi-
ence the visual phenomenon of the appearance of bright moon halos or two
distinct moons, thus the Bridge Zone is known as the path of the Night of the
two Moons.
    •   Bridging Humans will be free from Dracos-Zeta manipulation & will
have progressively more open relations with guardian ET cultures.
     •  The Halls of Amenti ascension passages & the Hall of Records race
history will be open to populations of Bridge Zone Earth & a new age of
enlightenment will begin.
     •   The Bridge Zone represents the ful fillment of a guardian initiated Earth
rescue mission through which the integrity of the human evolutionary blue-
print will be secured. Bridge Zone Earth is the second most desirable path &
one that will be taken by about 8% of Earth's populations.
                                    
                               CHOOSING YOUR FUTURE
          The path you will find yourself on between 2012 - 2017 will be deter-
mined by your choices now. The key to ascending to the Bridge Zone or Tara
is Bodily Transmutation, which is achieved through the rapid assembly and
activation of DNA strands & the awakening of dormant gene codes. DNA
evolution can be accelerated by consciously using the bio-energetic chakra
system to activate the dormant Star Crystal Seals within the human body &
bio-energetic field. These hidden morphogenetic seals control the operation
of the DNA and when activated allow for transmutation of the cellular struc-
ture from one space-time station to others. Earth’s upcoming Transmutative
Stellar Activation period will allow humanity the opportunity for rapid Star
Crystal Seal activation & DNA acceleration, through which transmutative
self-evacuation from Descending Earth can be achieved. You have free will to
choose what future you will see, within the greater framework of Earth’s evo-
lutionary course; this course now offer three primary options.

                                                 Exploring Ultra-Micro Particle Mechanics
        Keylonta is the science of energy dynamics as they apply to a multidi-
mensional, perpetual motion universe. lt is the primary foundation upon
which all advanced sciences and technologies of light, sound, frequency, and
electromagnetic energy are built. Keylontic Science deals with the underly-
ing structures of electromagnetic energy through which all matter forms are
constructed and with the attributes of electro-tonal energy structure through
which consciousness achieves diversification and individuation. Foundations
of Keylontic Science arise out of a larger category of multidimensional scien-
tific study known as the Science of Vibrational Mechanics . The Science of
Vibrational Mechanics utilizes a schematic of cosmic order that is created
through the inherent dynamics of fission and fusion of electro-tonal energy
units, an order through which the natural laws of the cosmos are set and held
in motion. Keylontic Science employs these natural laws as they apply to the
structures and dynamics of energy, matter and consciousness that are created
through these laws. Keylonta can be viewed as the science of creation, for it is
through the dynamics of Keylontic Science that creation takes place. There
is an organizational intelligence and sentient creative force of vast propor-
tions that is responsible for the design and creation of the cosmos. Through
Keylontic Science we can explore the dynamics of energy and consciousness
through which the cosmos and all forms and beings within it, receive this
design through the Central Creative Source.  
      The cosmic schematic is organized into a formation of two polarized
Cosmic Cores and 12 Meta-Galactic Cores, both united through and existing
within the Central Source of Creation. The Guardians refer to this Central
Source as the Yunasai and it is the sentient, creative identity-in-energy

Introduction to Keylonta  
through and within which the cosmos and its parts manifest. The 12 Meta-
Galactic Cores of the cosmos pair to form six primary reality fields in which
multidimensional reality systems take place.  
          Each of the six pairs of reality fields contains two 15-dimensional systems,
that are referred to as 15-dimensional Matrices.  In one 15-dimensional
Matrix there is one set of 15 dimensions that compose the particle universe
and one set of counter-rotating 15 dimensions that compose the anti-particle
reﬂection of the parallel universe. All life, evolution and form manifestation
takes place within the six 15-dimensional Matrices. The principles of energy
and consciousness that form these reality fields are the same as those that
manifest life forms and sentient consciousness within these fields; the same
dynamics of energy inter-relationships apply to the macrocosm and the
microcosm. The science of Keylonta allows us to study ourselves as interwo-
ven integral parts of this greater structure of the cosmos.  
      Keylontic Science has many diverse applications from communication,
healing, acceleration of the genetic code and advancement of spiritual evolu-
tion to the creation of advanced technologies such as manufacture of interdi-
mensional transport craft and free energy devices to the maneuvering of
time-space portals. Mastery of multidimensional science requires having
knowledge of the minute, electro-tonal units of energy that form all particles
and frequency bands within dimensional systems and the dynamics of elec-
tro-magnetism created through the interplay of these ultra-micro energy
units. Consciousness and matter are both composed of these units of electro-
tonal energy and so both spiritual and scienti fic mastery are brought together
through the applied knowledge of these electro-tonal energy dynamics. Key-
lontic Science provides the foundations of knowledge upon which mastery of
matter and consciousness can be achieved.  
        Keylontic Science derives its name from the word Keylon.  A Keylon is a
composite of ultra-micro electro-tonal energy units called Partiki.  Keylons
group with other Keylons to form dimensionalized, crystalline structures of
energy that exist as the base morphogenetic (form-holding) templates behind
and within all matter forms, particles and consciousness. Keylons compose
the frequency fields of sound and light upon which the entire Cosmic matrix
is structured; the Uni fied Field of cosmic energy is composed of groups of
crystalline Keylons. Keylons also compose the morphogenetic template of
electro-tonal and electromagnetic energy upon which the human DNA,
genetic code, physical body, bio-energetic chakra system and multidimen-
sional aspects of consciousness (the spiritual body) are built. In studying Key-
lons and the energetic dynamics inherent to Keylontic Science we can learn
to consciously direct the path of our physical and spiritual evolution.
Through this knowledge we can one day learn to master the contours of mat-
ter and consciousness as they apply to the simultaneously co-existing space-

                                                                         Six Primary Elements of Keylontic Science
time fields of the 15-dimensional Matrix, within which our present existence
takes place.  
   T o begin utilizing the potentials of Keylontic Science for personal devel-
opment, we must become aware of the basic components of which our bodies,
minds, consciousness and spirit are composed. Once we are aware of our per-
sonal energetic composition, we can begin to learn how to direct our inher-
ent energy to affect desired change within the physical, emotional, mental
and spiritual aspects of our existence. Keylontic Science offers us the oppor-
tunity to explore and utilize the portions of our personal reality that presently
remain hidden from our conscious view. The basic principle in using Keylon-
tic Science is to understand the mechanics by which the elements of Keylon-
tic Science interrelate with the components of multidimensional anatomy.
The first step in the study of Keylonta is becoming familiar with the six pri-
mary elements of Keylontic Science.  
                  
                                     SIX PRIMARY ELEMENTS OF KEYLONTIC SCIENCE       
     1. Partiki : Partiki represent the units of crystalline morphogenetic sub-
stance out of which particles and anti-particles emerge. Partiki are units of
electro-tonal energy-identity that emanate from a central cosmic source
called the  Y unasai.  Partiki are the primary units of energy that form all mat-
ter, anti-matter, pre-matter and non-matter substance. They are units of mul-
tidimensional light-sound and consciousness that represent minute
projections of energy-identity from the central creative cosmic source. Partiki
are the organizational intelligence and operational “life-force fuel” behind
and within all manifestations and consciousness. Partiki operate as minute
self-regenerating “ fission-fusion generators.” Through the dynamics of their
interaction they create and maintain the electromagnetic fields of sound fre-
quency and light spectra of which the cosmos is composed.  
            Partiki are the smallest units of energy in the cosmos  (one could find 800 bil-
lion billion Partiki units in an average 3-dimensional photon). They exist
within and beyond all particle and matter structures and represent the
“divine substance” out of which the cosmos is composed. Through interior
polarization and replication, created through self-generated fission and
fusion, Partiki manufacture two intrinsic sub-units of crystalline morphoge-
netic substance that serve as blueprints for rhythms of pulsation through
which particles and anti-particles manifest. The Partiki sub-units that pulsate
the fastest are called Partika  and they set the pulsation rhythm through
which Partiki units will group to form anti-particles.  
      Partiki sub-units that pulsate more slowly and appear in conjunction
with the Partika are called Particum.  The Particum set the pulsation rhythm
through which Partiki units will group to form particles  that are a slower pul-
sating reflection of the Partika anti-particles. Together the Partiki, Partika
and Particum set the foundations for particle and anti-particle manifestation

Introduction to Keylonta  
within the Uni fied Fields of the 15-dimensional Matrix. They are the ener-
getic substances, through which the base electro-magnetism that keeps the
universe and parallel universe in motion is manufactured.  
   Each Partiki perpetually breaks down into Particum and Partika, particle
and anti-particle, while simultaneously replicating the original Partiki,
through the act of internal fission. The replication serves to retain the pat-
tern of the original, while the Particum and Partika serve to draw other Par-
tiki units from the Uni fied Field. The Particum and Partika are then
magnetically drawn back together in an act of fusion, through which they
merge with the replica of the original Partiki out of which they were created.
During fusion the Particum and Partika draw new energy patterns in the form
of Partiki units back into the morphogenetic structure of the original Partiki,
which expands the original pattern while retaining its organic integrity.
Through this process crystalline composite forms are created, which serve as
the morphogenetic blueprints through which individuated forms and identity
will manifest.  
  The Partika perpetually circulate energy from the original Partiki
through the Cosmic Matrix and the Particum perpetually draw energy from
the Uni fied Field of the Cosmic Matrix back into the morphogenetic form of
the Partiki, expanding its original form. Through this dynamic a perpetual
motion, expanding and contracting universe and parallel universe are perpet-
ually re-created and eternally sustained.  
       Partiki can be viewed in spiritual terms as units of the identity of  God, the cen-
tral creative source . All things are composed of Partiki and thus all things,
beings and consciousness are intrinsically holy as they are composed of and
united through the eternal substance of God. This God-substance of Partiki
allows for individuation of form and identity to be created, creates diversi fica-
tion through a greater field of uni fied consciousness and manufactures the
morphogenetic design through which all individuation and manifestation
takes place.  
    2. Partiki Grids: Partiki units group by like polarization, electrical Par-
tika to Partika, magnetic Particum to Particum, forming strings of energy
units called Partiki Strands.  Partiki Strands group with other such strands to
form geometrical “fabrics” or grids of electro-tonal, electromagnetic energy
that serve as a template of light spectra and sound tones upon which particle
and anti-particle structure forms. These templates of Partiki units are called
Partiki Grids  and they form a Uni fied Field of living energy substance
through which all things in the cosmos are energetically united.  
     All forms of matter and consciousness possess a Partiki Grid at the core of
their individual structure that holds the morphogenetic imprint for the form
or identity and the intrinsic base pattern for the particles and anti-particles
that will manifest that form into matter. The personal Partiki Grid is inti-
mately interwoven with the greater Partiki Grid of the Cosmic Uni fied Field.

                                                                         Six Primary Elements of Keylontic Science
All things are eternally, energetically connected to the energy-identity of the
Yunasai/God through the electro-tonal, electromagnetic reality of the Partiki
Grids. Following the pattern of organizational intelligence set by the Yunasai
and carried within the Partiki units, Partiki Grids draw in more units of Par-
tiki from the Uni fied Field, forming more complex geometrical arrangements
of Partiki Strands which become the crystalline dimensionalized templates
upon which all forms are constructed. Partiki strands represent the fibers out
of which individuated morphogenetic fabrics are woven and are the second
state of being between pure conscious energy-identity and manifestation of
form.  
        Partiki Grids represent the morphogenetic fabrics into which tapestries of crys-
talline matter blueprints are laid and are the third state of being between pure con-
sciousness and manifestation of form.  
        3. Keylons:  Keylons are dimensionalized, geometrically formed Partiki
composites, composed of more complex arrangements of Partiki Strands that
form around the base structure of the Partiki Grids. Keylons are minute crys-
talline structures composed of Partiki that form the dimensionality of con-
sciousness and matter. Keylons and the Partiki within them are the “building
blocks of frequency” or sound tones, which are the core structures upon
which matter and consciousness are built. Keylons direct the rhythm of
expansion-projection and contraction-retraction of Partiki units throughout
the cosmos and within the Partiki Grids of all forms. They set the foundation
structures upon which biology and the perception of space, time and matter
are built. Partiki units set the base electromagnetic fields through which
dimensionalization takes place and Keylons direct the contours of how Par-
tiki units will build up into form within those electromagnetic fields. Keylons
form the crystalline matrix of electro-tonal energy that runs through all
things.  
       Keylons represent the primary tapestries of crystalline morphogenetic matter
blueprints upon which sub. particle and sub-anti-particle pre-matter substance will
form. Keylons are the fourth step between pure consciousness and form manifesta-
tion. 
       4. Keylon Codes:  A Keylon Code is a complex grouping of Keylons that
further direct the contours of energy upon which forms are built. Keylon
Codes serve to direct the in- ﬂow and out- ﬂow of Partiki unit energy within
the morphogenetic blueprint of a form into more specific patterns, rhythms of
movement and electro-tonal vibration. All forms of matter and conscious-
ness are structured upon speci fic sets of Keylon Codes that determine the base
atomic and genetic makeup of a form and the characteristics of consciousness
the form will possess. Keylon Codes represent complex patterns of interwo-
ven sound tones and light spectra that form compound morphogenetic crys-
talline structures that serve as the templates of living light and sound to
455 
                                     

Introduction to Keylonta  
which pre-matter sub-particles and matter and anti-matter particles will
adhere.  
      Keylon Codes create and hold together the primary morphogenetic
structure of individuated form; they are the primary structure and organiza-
tional collective intelligence within all things. The manifest attributes of all
matter forms and consciousness can be affected through directed alteration of
existing Keylon Code structures.  
            Keylon Codes represent the compound tapestries of crystalline morphogenetic
matter blueprints upon which pre-matter, anti-matter and matter particles will
 form. They are the ﬁfth state of being between pure consciousness and form mani-
 festation and serve as the complex, multidimensional, morphogenetic blueprint
through which all individuated forms manifest.  
       5. The Crystal Body:  This term is used to refer to the multidimensional
Keylon Code structure of a matter form or form of consciousness. The Crystal
Body represents the individuated morphogenetic construction of a form
through which the contours of its manifest attributes will take shape. The
morphogenetic Crystal Body sets the manifest characteristics a form will pos-
sess, its intrinsic sub-atomic structure, body rhythms, metabolic rate and the
foundations of DNA, the manner in which Partiki units will move through
the form and the type of conscious awareness the form will embody. The
human Crystal Body encompasses 12 dimensions of identity, sound frequency
and light spectra and sets the structure for the bio-energetic chakra system,
auric field and electromagnetic Merkaba Fields (counter-rotating spirals of
multidimensional electromagnetic energy through which the auric field is
formed).  
            The Crystal Body represents the collective ﬁfth state of being between pure con-
sciousness and form manifestation, in relation to an individuated construction of
consciousness or matter . Through the Crystal Body the electromagnetic Merk-
aba Fields of a form are designed and constructed.  
      The Merkaba Fields represent the sixth state of being between pure conscious-
ness and form manifestation.  Through the counter rotating electromagnetic
fields of the Merkaba Fields the contours for the bio-energetic auric field and
chakra system are formed in accordance with the design set by the Crystal
Body.  
            The bio-energetic auric ﬁeld and chakra systems represent the seventh state of
being between consciousness and manifestation.  The bio-energetic field then
serves to direct Partiki units from the Dimensional Unified Fields into parti-
cle or anti-particle construction through which the DNA and biological par-
ticle base of a form is set in to the dimensional framework. Through the bio-
energetic system the pre-matter construction of a biological form is created.
This pre-matter construction is referred to as the Nadis  and Nadial Capsule.
The Nadial Capsule separates the levels of the auric field and the identity
into 3-dimensional divisions and the Nadis serve as a system of minute pre-
456                                                                    

                                              Six Primary Elements of Keylontic Science  
matter channels through which Partiki unit energy from the auric field ﬂows
into the particle manifestation of the body.  
        The Nadis and Nadial Capsule represent the eighth state of being between con-
sciousness and manifestation. The particle and anti-particle construction which
builds up through the pre-matter Nadis into a form's manifest particles or anti-parti-
cles following the design set by the Crystal Body, represent the ninth state of being
between consciousness and manifestation.  The multidimensional spiritual body
of the Soul Matrix and Over-Soul Matrix are part of the individuated mor-
phogenetic Crystal Body of humans, and these aspects of Eternal identity are
composed of Keylon Codes, Keylons and Partiki units, just as the physical
body is composed of these substances. The Crystal Body serves as the under-
lying structure of all matter and consciousness, connects the physical aspects
of being and identity to the multidimensional Soul and Over-Soul Matrices
and connects each individuated form to the greater Crystal Body of the Cos-
mic Uni fied Field. Through directed interaction with the morphogenetic
Crystal Body both genetic and spiritual aspects of human evolution can be
expanded and accelerated.  
       6. Light-symbol Codes:  A Light-Symbol Code is a pattern of electro-
tonal energy composed of speci fic Partiki configurations that make up fre-
quencies of sound and spectra of light. These patterns of light and sound
direct the speed, angles of interface and patterns of refraction and replication
that Partiki units will follow within the Keylon Code structure of the Crystal
Body. Light-Symbol Codes control the way energy will move and manifest
within a form; they serve as the organizational “program” within all Keylons.
By altering the Light-Symbol Code program within the Keylon Codes of the
morphogenetic Crystal Body, the structure of the Keylon Codes and thus the
manifestations they create can be changed.  
       Human evolution of body and consciousness can be accelerated by acti-
vating certain Light-Symbol Codes that are presently dormant within the
Keylon Code structure of the Crystal Body. Once activated these dormant
Light-Symbol Codes direct the morphogenetic Crystal Body, bioenergetic
auric field and chakra system and DNA to operate in new ways. Light-Sym-
bol Codes direct sound tones and light spectra within the contours of the
Crystal Body. This directive serves to control the relationships between Par-
tiki units in the Crystal Body, which translates into operational instructions
for the bio-energetic system and DNA to follow. Light-Symbol Codes can be
used to direct patterns of frequency into the bio-energetic field and DNA in
very speci fic ways that will allow dormant potentials of the DNA to come
into operation. The DNA directs the manifest functions of the physical body
and the physically embodied consciousness, following the design set by the
Light-Symbol Code program within the Crystal Body.  
      Cellular Transmutation can be achieved by adding new frequency pat-
terns into the Crystal Body by changing the program of the Light-Symbol
457 
                                                                                                                
 

Introduction to Keylonta
Codes to hold the new frequency patterns. The use of internal and external
sound frequencies, light spectra and electromagnetic emanations creates hid-
den Light-Symbol Codes within the Crystal Body, which can program the
body toward health and wellness or disease and deterioration. The mind can
be used to direct speci fic Light-Symbol Codes and the electro-tonal programs
they carry into the Crystal Body to create healing, expansion of the genetic
code and conscious awareness and acceleration of multidimensional physical
and spiritual evolution. Through conscious direction of the Light-Symbol
Code programs the body can be freed from its present space-time orientation
by altering the particle pulsation rhythms of the body's dimensional particle
base, once the genetic code has been expanded.  
   Keylontic Science employs knowledge of the interrelationships between
these six primary elements to integrate the aspects of multidimensional iden-
tity and to create positive change and acceleration of evolution for all life
forms in the cosmos. Keylonta is also used to create tactile technologies that
assist in harmonious evolutionary progression. Keylontic Science is the study
of morphogenetic fields and the processes by and through which conscious-
ness becomes manifest. Units of identity from the central creative source
move through and build themselves up within the following states of being,
to become manifest forms and individuated identities as they evolve within
the 15-dimensional system:
1.   Morphogenetic Partiki Units of pure undifferentiated consciousness,
2.   Morphogenetic Partiki Strands,
3.   Morphogenetic Partiki Grids,
4.   Morphogenetic Keylons,
5.   Keylon Code Crystal Body composite morphogenetic fields,
6.   Electromagnetic Merkaba Fields,
7.   Bio-energetic fields and chakra systems,
8.   Pre-matter Nadial substance,
9.   Particle and Anti-particle construction,
10. Simple to complex matter and anti-matter forms, elemental composites,
     biological life-forms and sentient conscious identity and
11. Expanded compound morphogenetic identities of pure sentient conscious-
     ness, possessing complex 15-dimensional Crystal Body structures.Keylon-
     tic Science studies and implements the natural laws and dynamics
     inherent to the creation of matter and the evolution of consciousness.
      
   The Science of Keylonta can be viewed as the science of Light and
Sound (electro-tonal units of Partiki), the Sub-conscious Symbol Codes
(Light-Symbol Codes that program the Crystal Body and operate on a sub-
conscious level) and the Base Codes of Matter (the crystalline Keylon Codes

that make up the morphogenetic Crystal Body and form the basis of all struc-
ture). In simple terms Keylonta is the science of Creation and Consciousness,
through which mastery of mind and matter can be achieved and by which spiritual
integration and reunion with our creative Source is accomplished . The dynamics of
Keylonta continually operate within every human being and connect each
human to everything in the cosmos, regardless of whether humanity is con-
scious of this process. The science of Keylonta allows humans to become con-
scious co-creators within the multidimensional reality fields of the cosmos.
Keylonta is the scientific reality behind all of the sacred practices of religions
and mystical traditions. It represents the place where science meets its soul
and religion acknowledges the dynamics of energetic reality inherent to
spirit. Keylonta is the science of the future and of the ancient past, reaching
backward and forward through time to help humanity rediscover sovereignty
over its being today.                    
     Example of a Partiki Grid
“Lines of Light,” composed
of minute, electro-tonal Par-
tiki strands cross over and
through each other, creating
a myriad of geometrical
forms that serve as a “fabric
of light and sound,” or Par-
tiki Grid . The Partiki Grid
serves as a “collector” of Par-
tiki units, pulling in new
Partiki. As Partiki units
build up within the Partiki
grid, they begin to form more
complex structures of elec-
tro-tonal impulse that
become imbedded in the grid
as crystalline Keylon configurations, or Keylon Codes . The Keylon codes set
and hold the structure for all manifestations of matter, pre-matter, anti-mat-
ter and energy fields. Partiki Grids create  the Unified Field of Energy and
Consciousness,  within which all things in the dimensionalized universe
reside and Keylon Codes create individuation of form and consciousness
within the Unified Field. Keylon Codes direct the patterns of Partiki fission/
fusion and the patterns of refraction and replication of electro-tonal energy
that allow for differentiation of form and consciousness within the unified
Partiki grid of  the Cosmic Matrix.

                                                   WELCOME TO THE FIFTH WORLD
    Many tribal cultures throughout our recent history have shared a rich tra-
dition of prophecy regarding the transitions Earth will encounter during its
2017 ascension cycle. Prophecies of events to come during this period have
been interwoven with race creation stories and mythologies for over 26,556
years. Though the Bridge Zone Project is a new addition to the roster of
events soon scheduled to occur, intuitive knowledge of the ascension cycle
period and the close of the 26,556-year Euiago time cycle has remained alive
within numerous cultures of Earth for thousands of years. This hidden knowl-
edge has shown itself within the Biblical prophecies of Revelations; it was the
foundation for many rites of passage among the Essenes and other historical
mystical societies.  
    Reference to this ascension cycle can be found within the calculations of
the Mayan calendar and inscriptions within the ancient Egyptian pyramids
and this knowledge has played a major role within the rich tapestry of Native
American oral tradition. The knowledge that Earth and the human race
would face something monumental during the “end times” has been the com-
prehension of visionaries throughout the course of recorded history. The “end
times” represent the point in Earth’s evolution when the planet has com-
pleted a cycle of 26,556 years and moves forward through its ascension period
to begin a new cycle.  
   Our upcoming “end times” hold a promise not present during the end
times of past 26,566-year cycles, for this is the first time the planetary grid
will vibrate high enough to allow planetary dimensional ascension to take
place. This opportunity has not been available on Earth for over 200,000
years. The Bridge Zone Project is made possible precisely because Earth is
approaching the end of its present time cycle. If it were not for the Bridge
Zone Project, Earth would once again be unable to ful fill the promise of
ascension, as without guardian intervention Earth’s grid would not have
reached the necessary level of vibration. The planet would have remained
within the HU-1 dimensions for another 26,566-year cycle. The new cycle
would have reached an early close with the destruction of Earth before the
next ascension period occurred.

                        Introduction to Keylonta
     In many Native American traditions, the coming “end times” ascension
cycle period is viewed as a transition from what is known as the Fourth
World to the Fifth World. The transition is perceived in relation to a much
longer cycle of history in which humanity evolved through three previous
“worlds,” or time periods marked by advanced civilization and high techno-
logical achievement. Contemporary historical analysis does not yet include
these hidden aspects of human evolution. The truth of humanity’s lost past
has remained protected through cultures living more closely in harmony with
the Earth’s natural cycles. We are indeed now approaching the Fifth World.  
  WORLD ONE:  560,000,000—550,750,000 years ago . The Alania
and Lumia of Tara, before the fall to HU-1.  
   WORLD TWO:  250,000,000—25,000,000 years ago . The five Clois-
ter Races of the 12 Tribes seeded on Parallel Earth.  
   WORLD THREE:  25,000,000—5,500,000 years ago . The First Seed-
ing of the 12 Tribes on Earth. The five Cloister Races and Root Race Three:
Lumanians and Four: Alanians. Ended via Electric Wars.             
    WORLD FOUR:  3,700,000 years ago to present. The Second Seeding
3,700,000—848,000 years ago, Root Races Three: Lamanians, Four: Atlanians
and Five: Ayrians and their Cloister Races. Ended via The Thousand-Year
War. The Third Seeding 75,000 years ago to present, Root Races Three:
Lemurians, Four: Atlanteans and Five: Aryans and their Cloisters.  
       Welcome to the Fifth W orld!  
      Between 5/ 5/2000-2017 Earth will make its transition from the present
 Fourth W orld of the D-3 time cycle, into the Fifth W orld of the Bridge Zone
 and Taran ascension time cycles. Due to the Guardians' Bridge Zone Project ,
  the cataclysmic events originally associated with the ''end times'' prophecies
 have been largely avoided. Though there may still be warfare and geographi-
              cal changes in some areas, the scale of these events will be much smaller than
              those foretold through ancient prophecies. There will indeed be a ''cleans-
               ing,'' as predicted by some Native American traditions. As the Earth sepa-
              rates into higher and lower vibrating particle bases, Bridge Zone Earth and
               Phantom Earth each will be ''cleansed'' of the other . Populations of the

    Earth is approaching a time continuum shift between 5/5/2000-2017.
This continuum shift represents a literal planetary time acceleration. Time
accelerations constitute an increase in particle pulsation rhythm for the
three-dimensional particle base of Earth. The human body exists as an intrin-
sic part of the particle content of Earth. As Earth's particle base accelerates in
pulsation rhythm, the particles that compose the human auric field will also
increase in pulsation rhythm. If the physical body and bio-neurological struc-
ture of the body are not prepared to synthesize the faster pulsating particles of
the auric field, this time acceleration will manifest as acceleration of the cel-
lular deterioration process.  
     For the body to retain its vitality through the Earth’s time acceleration,
the particle pulsation rhythm of the body’s three-dimensional particle base
must also increase. The Morphogenetic Seed Crystal Seals within the bio-
energetic system of the human body keep the body's particle base locked into
the pulsation rhythms of dimensions 1-3. In order to accelerate the pulsation
rhythm of the body’s particles, the Seed Crystal Seals must be released, to
unlock the body’s particles from the pulsation rhythms of dimensions l-3.
Seed Crystal Seals are opened by activation of the body’s Morphogenetic Star
Crystal Seals.  
     Star Crystal Seals are activated by awakening the dormant morphoge-
netic chakra centers and drawing new frequency patterns through the chakra
system and into the Star Crystal Seals. Activation and release of the Crystal
Seals creates activation of the dormant Silicate Matrix DNA Fire Codes
which in turn manufactures blood-crystal structures that raise the body’s met-
abolic rate and prepare the body for cellular acceleration. Stellar Activations
and Wave Infusions  are the process by which the Star Crystal Seals are acti-
vated and  Stellar Spiral Alignments  are the catalysts through which Stellar
Activations can occur. Humans who complete a minimum of 1.5 Stellar
Activations will be able to raise the particle pulsation rate of the body suffi-
ciently to avoid adverse effects of Earth’s time acceleration. The following

                  Transmutative Activations—Planetary and Persona l 
      All matter forms and forms of consciousness, including planetary bodies
and human bodies, are manifested through a morphogenetic (form-holding)
imprint, which exists as a quantity of crystalline, electro-tonal energetic sub-
stance that is composed of speci fic patterns of frequency. This morphogenetic
imprint sets the pattern for a form within the 15-dimensional Uni fied Field of
energy substance. The morphogenetic imprint holds the instructions and
design for form-building in a type of digital or electronic encoding, known as
Keylon Codes. Forms come into manifestation and evolve, as patterns of fre-
quency are drawn into the form’s morphogenetic field, from the dimensional
frequency bands of the Uni fied Field of energetic substance within which the
morphogenetic field is placed. This drawing-in of frequency progressively
expands the morphogenetic field and creates evolution of form progressively
upward through the 15-dimensional universe.  
      Within the 15-dimensional Uni fied Field, the morphogenetic field cre-
ates structures of multidimensional electromagnetic energy, around and
through which the matter form will manifest. These multidimensional EM
fields are collectively referred to as the bio-energetic system or the auric field
of a manifest form. All manifest forms possess a bio-energetic system/auric
field. The auric field has seven primary, inner layers through which physical
manifestation takes place and which correspond to dimensional frequency
bands 1 through 7. The auric field also has seven outer layers, which repre-
sent the form-holding morphogenetic imprints for the seven inner layers of
the auric field. The seven outer layers correspond to dimensional frequency
bands 9 through 15. The 14 layers of the auric field are connected to each
other through a central point within the eighth dimension Meta-galactic
Core. This center point represents the point through which a form’s original
morphogenetic imprint was entered into the 15-dimensional system.  
      All forms and beings are thus indelibly connected to each other and the
universe through interwoven morphogenetic fields that are united through
the D-8 center point. Energy moves from the seven outer morphogenetic lay-
ers of the auric field, through the seven inner layers and into manifestation
within dimensions 1-7, through the structure of dimensional Merkaba Fields
(sets of counter-rotating, electromagnetic energy spirals). Each form has fif-
teen dimensional Merkaba Fields, which hold its morphogenetic imprint
intact within the 15-dimensional Uni fied Field. Through the rotation of the
15 Merkaba Fields, an energy structure in the form of an “egg” or capsule is
formed within the dimensional Uni fied Field of each of the 15 dimensions.

                                                                                                              Stellar Activations
Through these dimensional energetic capsule structures, the chakra system,
or dimensional energy supply system, is formed. Through the chakra system a
form’s particle base builds up into structures of multidimensional matter. The
15 energetic capsules exist within the same space, separated by variance in
dimensional particle pulsation rhythms. The energetic form of the capsules
gives the auric field the appearance of capsules within capsules, or 15 distinct,
interpenetrating, capsule-shaped layers.  
      The process of dimensional ascension and biological and planetary evo-
lution is the process of accretion or the drawing of successive multidimen-
sional frequency bands into the morphogenetic field. As a planetary body or
human body evolves through frequency accretion, the energetic capsules
within the auric field progressively undergo transmutation of form. Once a
morphogenetic field has accreted most of the frequency bands from the three
dimensions that compose one Harmonic Universe, the energy capsules that
correspond to these three lower dimensions begin to dissolve. The particles
contained within the dissolving auric capsules open into the auric capsules of
the next three highest dimensions, in the next Harmonic universe up. This is
the energetic dynamic by which forms and consciousness progressively evolve
from one Harmonic Universe to the next.  
      The process of dissolving the lower-dimensional energy capsules and
transmuting their particle content into next Harmonic Universe is referred
to as a  Transmutative Activation  or Stellar Activation.  Stellar Activations
are a natural part of the accretion/evolution process, and occur as the pulsa-
tion rhythm of particles in the lower three dimensions speeds up into the
rhythms of the next three dimensional frequency bands. Through the process
of Stellar Activations the levels/capsules of the auric field progressively open
up into each other, dissolving the dimensional frequency barriers that kept
the levels separate within the morphogenetic field. The levels dissolve as the
morphogenetic field progressively draws in more frequency patterns from the
dimensional Uni fied Fields.  
       As the levels dissolve, progressively more energy and awareness merge
with and become held within, the matter-form, and the matter-form shifts
from one set of dimensional time continuum cycles to another. Earth and the
human populations are now approaching a series of Stellar Activations, as
part of Earth’s natural 26,556-year Euiago cycle. The auric field of the planet
and those of Earth’s populations will undergo transformation between 2000
AD-2017 AD. In order for humans to achieve ascension to the Bridge Zone
Earth and avoid becoming trapped in the D-3 time cycle, a minimum of one
and one half personal Stellar Activations must take place. Earth will experi-
ence six such activations between 2000-2017.  
       Humans who do not prepare the body, consciousness and chakra system
for these activations will be unable to shift into the Bridge Zone time contin-
uum or ascend to Tara and beyond. (This applies to disembodied, HU-1 soul

essences, as well as to souls living within HU-1 bodies.) They will also expe-
rience varying degrees of disruption within their personal auric field, chakra
system, DNA and physical, mental and emotional bodies.  
  The Transmutative Activations are referred to as Stellar Activations
because the infusions of progressively higher-dimensional frequency bands
that transmit into the auric fields of Earth and humans, enter into the Earth’s
bio-energetic field through a chain of spiraling, dimensional Merkaba Fields.
The frequency infusions come to Earth following a path of Merkaba Fields
that runs through various star systems before entering Earth’s system through
the Pleiadian-Alcyone and Solar spirals.  
   The six Transmutative Activations, with which we are now concerned,
interface with Earth through the following spiraling, inter-stellar energetic
path: D-10 Lyra-Andromeda, D-9 Andromeda-Galactic Core Morphogenetic
Field, D-8 Meta-galactic Core and Orion, D-7 Arcturus, D-6 Sirius, D-5 Ple-
iades-Alcyone, D-4 Solar Spiral, D-3 Earth. As each of these spiraling Stellar
Merkaba Fields come into alignment with each other and with the three-
dimensional Merkaba Fields of Earth, the frequency patterns associated with
each spiral progressively enter into the Earth’s bio-energetic system and core.
This infusion of multidimensional frequency, which transmits to Earth in the
form of light, sound, electromagnetic and scalar waves that are beyond pres-
ently identi fied spectra and frequency bands, directly alters the particle pulsa-
tion rhythm of Earth’s three-dimensional particle base. This in turn directly
affects the bio-energetic fields of all life forms on the planet and thus the met-
abolic and biological processes of the body that are controlled through the
personal bio-energetic field.

   As the Stellar Activations progressively take place, infusions of UHF
energy begin running through the auric fields of Earth and humans, causing
particle pulsation rhythms to increase and accelerating the Stellar Activation
process. Six Stellar Activations will soon occur on Earth and humans work-
ing to build DNA will also have the opportunity to undergo six Stellar Acti-
vations. Stellar Wave Infusions are a natural part of the DNA evolution
process and will become part of the experiential reality of humans upon the
Bridge Zone or Ascension paths.  
   The first Stellar Activation begins following an infusion of energy into
the Earth’s core, through which the Earth’s core particle pulsation rhythm is
raised high enough to merge with the frequency bands of the first Stellar Spi-
ral, when it aligns with Earth’s Merkaba Fields during the ascension cycle.

Normally the ascension cycle initiates because the human populations of
Earth have reached a high enough vibration of consciousness and DNA
assembly level to pull Stellar Frequency into their bio-energetic fields. 
   The bio-energetic fields of the human collective then serve to raise the
particle pulsation speed of Earth’s grid, which raises the pulsation rhythm of
Earth’s core high enough to link with the Stellar Spirals when they begin to
align with Earth’s Merkaba Fields. Thus humans assist the planet in its parti-
cle evolution. If the consciousness, DNA and bio-energetic fields of humans
are not at a high enough particle pulsation rhythm when the Stellar Spirals
align with Earth, the Earth’s core pulsation rhythm will be too low to link
with the frequencies of the Stellar Spirals. In this case Earth’s Stellar Activa-
tions would not take place, the planet would remain within its HU-1 time
cycle until the next Stellar Spiral alignment and the opportunity for acceler-
ated planetary evolution and dimensional ascension would pass by.  
   If the Guardians had not intervened and arti ficially infused Earth’s core
with D-4 frequency, Earth would not have been able to link with the Stellar
Spirals during this ascension cycle; the opportunity for Earth’s ascension to a
faster moving time continuum and escape from Dracos-Zeta Resistance in fil-
tration would not have been available. The human collective consciousness
alone did not reach a high enough vibration level, the DNA had not assem-
bled enough to create the initial Earth-grid acceleration that would prepare
Earth to receive the frequencies of the Stellar Spirals. The Guardians inter-
vened directly to avert the pending destruction of Earth and the Pleiadian
Star system that would otherwise have taken place in 2976 AD due to Dracos-
Zeta Resistance in filtration. Originally the Guardians planned only to assist
in stimulating the Earth’s core and aligning Earth’s Merkaba Fields to receive
the Stellar Spirals during the ascension period. The rest was to be left up to
humanity’s ability to evolve. Once the pending cataclysm of 2976 AD was
discovered, direct intervention in Earth’s affairs was permitted.  
    Because of the Guardians efforts, Earth is now prepared to receive its first
Stellar Activation on 5/5/2000. During the past seven 26,556-year Euiago
cycles, Earth has been unable to successfully link with the Stellar Spirals to
achieve Stellar Activations. Earth is now approaching the end of its eighth
Euiago cycle, which would naturally occur in 4230 AD, at the close of the
present ascension cycle. Earth and the human lineage have been trapped in
the HU-1 time cycles for 210,216 years to date. The coming period of Stellar
Activations has not been available to or witnessed by members of the present
lineage of the human race, which began with the Third Seeding of the Root
Races 75,000 years ago.  
   Because of the Guardians’  intervention and the necessity of the Bridge
Zone Project, this opportunity and the challenges it will present are available
to the current generation of humans. The events that will occur on and with

Ascension Cycle Dynamics  
the molecular and bio-energetic structure of Earth during the 2000-2017 AD
Stellar Activation cycle are unprecedented in recorded human history.  
   The first Stellar Activation begins as a result of Earth’s core pulsation
rhythm reaching a sufficient rate of speed to link with the first aligning Stel-
lar Spiral. Stellar Wave Infusions begin after the onset of the first Stellar
Activation. Halfway through the first Stellar Activation, the first Stellar
Wave Infusion begins. Through the Infusion, the frequency bands of the next
Stellar Activation are entered into the personal morphogenetic fields of
humans and the morphogenetic field of Earth’s core, while the first Activa-
tion is still underway.  
   When the first Stellar Activation is complete, all frequency bands associ-
ated with it have been released from the Earth’s morphogenetic field and are
transmitting through Earth’s grid. The next Stellar Activation begins as the
frequency bands entered into the Earth's morphogenetic field during the first
Stellar Wave Infusion cycle begin to transmit through Earth’s grid. This
sequence of Activation-Infusion-Activation continues through the six Stel-
lar Activations, and each Activation has a Stellar Wave Infusion halfway
through its activation cycle. The process operates within the human auric
field, DNA and body in the same way that it occurs within the Earth’s auric
field and particle body.  
   The first personal Stellar Activation occurs when the fourth DNA strand
begins to assemble (the fourth strand begins to assemble when the personal
morphogenetic field is at a 3-accretion level—all of the frequency bands of
D-1 through D-3 have been drawn into the morphogenetic field.) When half
of the fourth DNA strand is assembled (accretion level 3.5—all of dimen-
sional frequency bands one through three and one-half of the fourth-dimen-
sional frequency bands, are drawn into the morphogenetic field) the first
Stellar Wave Infusion begins within the human auric field and body.  
    By the end of the first Stellar Activation, the first level of the D-1 etheric
body auric capsule dissolves and its particles expand into the D-4 astral cap-
sule and increase their pulsation rhythm to that of the D-4 time cycle. As
each Stellar Activation and Wave Infusion continues, the HU-1 dimensional
auric capsules progressively dissolve and the particles pass into the HU-2
auric capsules, then the HU-2 particles expand into the HU-3 auric capsules
in like fashion. The auric level separations within the human auric field pro-
gressively collapse and the corresponding chakra centers activate and release
their seals. These bio-energetic changes cause higher-dimensional frequen-                                                                                        
cies to transmit through the DNA and body cells, which transmutes the cel-
lular structure, as the particles of the HU-1 body merge with their anti-
particles and increase their pulsation rhythm to that of HU-2.  
  The consciousness is transferred into the time cycles and three-dimen-
sional perceptual experience of HU-2 Tara, HU-3 Gaia or beyond, depending

                                                                                                             Stellar Wave Infusions
upon the level of Stellar Activation that is completed. These are the dynam-
ics of the science of ascension, which is one application of Keylontic Science. 
   The term Stellar W ave Infusion is derived from observation of the actual
energetic process that takes place as these higher-dimensional frequencies
enter the auric field. Once a DNA strand has reached one-half assembly, the
frequency bands from the dimensions above begin to ﬂow in spiraling, ener-
getic waves or sequential pulses of energy, through the lower-dimensional
Merkaba Fields of the body. When viewed with higher-sensory vision, the
energies carried on these energetic wave pulses appear as an infusion of col-
ored electricity or light spectra, bearing the hue associated with the dimen-
sional frequency band carried on the wave.  
   Stellar W ave Infusions not only affect the subtle body structures of the
human aura and chakra system, they directly interact with the physical body
construction, and can be felt as infusions of “jittery”, higher-vibrating electri-
cal current running through the body cells. As the Activations progress, the
Infusions become progressively more noticeable and intense, creating tem-
perature variations, changes in hormonal activity, alterations in sleeping and
eating patterns, fluctuations in bodily energy levels, change of the metabolic
rate, heart rate and breathing patterns, and various other bio-chemical and
neurological symptoms.  
    In bodies that are unprepared to receive the increase in particle pulsation
rhythms brought on by the Earth’s Stellar Activations, the Stellar Wave infu-
sions will create a mounting sense of mental, emotional and biological
fatigue. During Earth’s activations, the energetic systems of humans are
placed under a progressively increasing amount of electromagnetic stress at a
sub-atomic level. This stress will manifest itself in a variety of ways within
the human organism. Physical “sparking” of increased static electricity,
(which can occasionally affect the function of electrical and magnetic appa-
ratus) may develop in some individuals, until the auric body balances the
new frequencies within the body systems.  
   For most people the infusions will not produce such pronounced symp-
toms, but will rather manifest as progressively less subtle symptoms of degen-
eration, lessening of vitality and physical deterioration. The Stellar
Activations and Infusions progressively cause more noticeable physical symp-
toms, which begin subtly and progressively intensify. Through learning to use
the chakra system properly and developing the ability to consciously use
these new frequencies for positive evolution, the potential undesirable effects
of Earth’s Stellar Activations can be avoided.  
    The symptoms produced by Stellar W ave Infusions can be frightening if
one does not understand what is taking place and they can be life threatening
if the lower chakras have not been balanced and the physical body has not
been prepared for these alterations. Through  the Stellar Activations and

                        Ascension Cycle Dynamics
Wave Infusions new areas of the brain are brought out of dormancy and the
glandular systems of the body, such as the Thymus, Thyroid, Pineal and Pitu-
itary glands, undergo metamorphosis. People who choose the path of ascen-
sion, or who do not want to end up trapped in the D-3 “Phantom Earth” time
cycle, will need to be aware of these changes. In future communications we
will provide more detailed technical information as to how the Stellar Acti-
vations and Stellar Wave Infusions can be handled with as little discomfort as
possible. At this time we would simply like you to become aware of the con-
cepts of which we speak, so you may begin to consider how you will approach
the coming changes.  
    People who have not chosen the path of conscious, accelerated ascen-
sion still need preparation to accommodate these changes. The Earth body
will undergo six Stellar Activations and Infusions between 5/5/2000 and
2017, whether or not your personal bio-energetic system has been prepared. If
you do not know how to balance your personal subtle energy bodies in the
face of Earth’s grid accelerations, you may find rapid deterioration of your
physical, mental and emotional systems. Your soul identity will attempt to
balance the energies and prepare your body to handle the new frequencies,
but you need to work consciously with your higher identity to employ
changes in habitual mental, emotional and physical activities that may be
detrimental to the process. The Guardian Alliance will offer a program for
Ascension Cycle Adaptation as soon as possible, for those who are interested
in gaining survival skills in this area. For now, you can simply learn about the
auric field and chakra systems through available resources, and begin working
to clear and balance your in-body chakras through energy work, visualization,
toning and other holistic health practices.

                  Stellar Spirals, Stellar Activations and Wave Infusions  
   During the two ascension cycle periods at the beginning and end of a
26,556-year Harmonic Universe Euiago cycle, certain alignments of multidi-
mensional Merkaba Fields take place. At these times, the spiraling electro-
magnetic currents of the multidimensional Merkaba Fields blend into each
other, forming a large 15-dimensional, spiraling pathway of energy transit
from the Meta-galactic Core at D-8 to all of the other dimensional systems.
These spirals of EM energy run through various galaxies and star systems
before entering into Earth’s solar system. There is a natural pathway of inter-
dimensional Merkaba Field alignment through which these energies interface                                                                                               
with Earth during the second ascension cycle period.    
   The form-holding morphogenetic imprint for the Milky Way Galaxy exists 
within the frequency bands of D-9, thus D-9 is considered to represent 
the Galactic Core. (D-8 holds the morphogenetic field for the entire 15-

                                                                                                                   The Stellar Bridge
dimensional Universe, and is thus considered the Meta-Galactic Core.) The
D-9 Galactic Core is located, in spatial terms, within the Andromeda Star
System. Part of Andromeda is located within D-10 frequency bands and is
connected to the D-10 Lyra Star system (Lyra extends from D-10 through D-
12) and part of Andromeda is located within D-9 frequency bands.  
    The Merkaba Field spirals of the Andromeda system are composed of D-9
and D-10 frequency bands and when this D-9/D-10 Merkaba Field interfaces
with the D-1/D-2/D-3 Merkaba Fields of Earth, D-9/D-10 frequencies trans-
mit into Earth’s core and run through Earth’s grid. The D-9/D-10 Merkaba
Fields cannot directly interface with the lower-dimensional Merkaba Fields of
Earth, these EM spirals must connect with a series of other stellar Merkaba
Field spirals in order for a “frequency bridge” to be established between the
higher and lower-dimensional Merkaba Field spirals.  
    This frequency bridge occurs only during certain time periods, when the
Merkaba Fields of these various star systems come into direct alignment with
each other, four times every 26,556 years; twice at the beginning and twice at
the end of the 26,556-year period. When this alignment of spiraling EM
Merkaba Fields occurs, Earth has the opportunity to raise the pulsation speed
of its particle base into that of higher-dimensional time cycles. At these times
interdimensional portals/passageways between Harmonic Universes, dimen-
sional bands and time cycles open and a planet or person can ascend into the
planetary systems of higher-dimensional time cycles or out-of-form manifes-
tation.  
  The pathway of multidimensional, inter-stellar Merkaba Field spiral
alignment runs from the higher-dimensional fields of D-10 Lyra-Andromeda,
through D-9 Andromeda-Galactic Core, D-8 Orion-Meta-galactic Core, D-7
Arcturus, D-6 Sirius, D-5 Pleiades-Alcyone and into the D-4 Solar Merkaba
Field spiral, then down into the D-3/D-2/D-1 Merkaba Fields of Earth. Each
of these inter-stellar dimensional Merkaba Field spirals is referred to as a Stel-
lar Spiral.  Each Stellar Spiral bears the name of the star system through
which it flows and carries within its energy field the light spectra and fre-
quency bands embodied within that star system.  
    Earth is now approaching the alignment of the Stellar Spiral Bridge that
runs from D-9 Andromeda down through the D-4 Solar Spiral to Earth.
Earth’s alignment with each spiral of the Stellar Spiral Bridge occurs in six
phases, beginning with the D-4 Solar Spiral upward through the D-9
Andromeda Spiral.  
    The point at which a Stellar Spiral aligns with the Merkaba Field spirals
of Earth begins a Transmutative Stellar Activation.  Between 5/5/2000 and
2017 Earth will experience six Stellar Activations, through which the six
Stellar Spirals of the multidimensional Earth-to-Andromeda Stellar Bridge
progressively align with Earth’s Merkaba Fields. During each Stellar Activa-
tion, the dimensional frequencies carried within the activating spiral begin to

transmit through Earth's core morphogenetic field and grid, raising the pulsa-
tion rhythms of Earth’s 3-dimensional particle base. It is through this process
that Earth’s grid is raised into the HU-2 time cycle to merge with the grid of
Tara. Before a Stellar Activation begins, the frequencies of the activating
Stellar Spiral are entered into Earth's core morphogenetic field through a
Stellar Wave Infusion.  In simple terms, a Stellar Wave Infusion begins when a Stellar Spiral
begins to align with Earth’s Merkaba Field spirals, and through the Stellar
Wave Infusion, the frequencies of that Stellar Spiral begin to enter Earth’s
core morphogenetic field. A Stellar Activation occurs as the Stellar Spiral
comes into full alignment with Earth's Merkaba Field spirals. At this time,
the frequencies from the Stellar Wave Infusion that have been building up
within Earth’s morphogenetic field begin to release from the morphogenetic
field and transmit through Earth’s 3-dimensional grid and particle base.  
   When half of the frequencies of a Stellar Spiral are released into Earth’ s
grid, halfway through the Activation, the remaining frequencies of the Stel-
lar Spiral completely “download” into Earth’s morphogenetic field. Once all
of the frequencies of a Stellar Spiral have fully entered Earth's morphogenetic
field, the next dimensional Stellar Spiral begins alignment with Earth and
the next Stellar Wave Infusion begins.  
   When half of the frequencies of the new Stellar Spiral have entered
Earth’s morphogenetic field, all of the frequencies from the previous Stellar
Spiral complete activating/transmitting through Earth’s grid, the previous
Stellar Activation ends and the next Activation begins. Halfway through the
next Activation, the previous Wave Infusion ends and the next Wave Infu-
sion begins. The process of Stellar Activations and Stellar Wave Infusions
represents a complex, multidimensional synchronization of Stellar Spiral
movement. It is not necessary to comprehend the complexities of this pro-
cess, but at this time it is important for you to know the basic mechanics of
Stellar Spiral alignment, as you will be faced with these conditions between
5/5/2000 and 2017.  
   Earth will experience six Stellar Activations and W ave Infusions, which
will alter the pulsation speed of Earth’s three-dimensional particle base, as
progressively higher frequencies are transmitted through Earth’s grid. If
Earth’s core had not been raised to a high enough particle pulsation rhythm,
via the Guardians D-4 frequency transmissions, the Solar Spiral would not
have been able to transmit its D-4 frequencies into Earth's core when the
Solar Spiral aligns with Earth’s Merkaba Fields on 5/5/2000. Earth would
have been unable to begin its Stellar Activations and Wave Infusion cycle,
and thus would have remained trapped within the D-3 time continuum,
unable to enter the Bridge Zone continuum.  
   The outcome of this would have been planetary destruction in 2976 AD,
due to Dracos-Zeta Resistance in filtration. We want you to understand the

principle of raising core pulsation rhythm high enough to receive frequency
transmissions from the Stellar Spirals, for this principle applies directly to
your bodies and consciousness, as well as to planetary energy dynamics.  
   If the core energy centers within your bodies are not raised to sufficient
pulsation rhythm to receive the stellar frequencies which will be transmitting
through Earth’s grid during Earth's Stellar Activations, you will be unable to
accompany Earth in the Stellar Activation process. In this case, Earth will
make the shift into the Bridge Zone time continuum, but you will not; you
will find yourselves stationed upon the ''Phantom Earth'' Descending Planet.
On Phantom Earth you will be cut off from your soul matrix and evolutionary
blueprint and in need of a Host Soul Matrix Transplant in order to continue
evolution. Humans are connected to their HU-2 soul matrix via the Sphere
of Amenti race morphogenetic field, which will remain at the core of Bridge
Zone Earth. This condition can be avoided through conscious participation
in the Stellar Activation process.                         
                          MORPHOGENETIC CRYSTAL SEALS  
       Seed Crystals, Star Crystals and Transmutation of the Human Body  
   As Earth enters its cycle of Stellar Activations and Stellar Wave Infu-
sions, humans also have the opportunity to participate in Activations and
Infusions, which will accelerate the evolution of the DNA, body and con-
sciousness and allow humans to enter the time continua of the Bridge Zone
or Tara, for continued evolution. The process of Stellar Activations, as it
applies to people, operates energetically in a way similar to that of planetary
Activations. In planetary Activations, progressively higher-dimensional
sound frequencies and light spectra run through the Earth's grid and three-
dimensional particle base, as the Earth's Merkaba Fields link with and draw
energy from the Stellar Spirals.  
   In humans, the three Merkaba Fields of the physical, mental and emo-
tional levels of the bio-energetic field draw energy from the Stellar Spirals via
the Earth’s three-dimensional Merkaba Fields and grid, through the higher-
dimensional chakras. This energy then moves into the three-dimensional
body via the lower-dimensional chakras. Once stellar frequency is pulled into
the human bio-energetic field, it is passed into the multidimensional, per-
sonal morphogenetic field of the human via Stellar Wave Infusions, just as
stellar frequencies are added to the Earth’s core morphogenetic field through
Wave Infusions.   
  Planetary bodies and human bodies are multidimensional in structure.
The primary morphogenetic identity (form-holding pattern) for galaxies,
planets and people is held within the entry point to the 15-dimensional sys-
tem, the D-8 Meta-Galactic Core. From that point the morphogenetic design
spreads outward into each of the 15-dimensional particle fields. The slower

Ascension Cycle Dynamics  
moving particle fields of dimensions 1-7 hold the morphogenetic design of a
form as it will manifest within varying degrees of matter density. The faster
moving particle fields of dimensions 9-15 hold the morphogenetic design of a
form as it exists in terms of pure, electro-tonal conscious energy. Morphoge-
netic dimensions 9-15 are connected to dimensions 1-7 through the D-8
Meta-Galactic Core and energy continually circulates through this 15-
dimensional structure.  
   The collective Uni fied Field of the 15-dimensional Universal system is
referred to as the 15-Dimensional Matrix. Both planets and people are organ-
ically connected to each of the 15 dimensions within the 15-dimensional
Matrix. The 15-Dimensional Matrix is structured into five groups of three
dimensions called Harmonic Universes and portions of the personal and
planetary morphogenetic fields are contained within each of the five Har-
monic Universes. Earth represents the HU-1 portion of the planet, Tara rep-
resents the HU-2 version of Earth and Gaia represents the HU-3 version of
Earth. In terms of humans, the incarnates of Earth are the HU-1 expressions
of the personal morphogenetic field, the Soul Matrix or Dora (dimensions 4,
5 and 6) is the HU-2 version of the personal identity and the Over-Soul
Matrix or Teura  (dimensions 7, 8, and 9) is the HU-3 version of that iden-
tity. In like fashion, Tara can be viewed as Earth’s soul and Gaia as Earth’s
Over-soul. There are also versions of each planet and person that exist as
non-matter energy forms within HU-4 and HU-5.  
   Each planet and person is connected to each of the seven lower-dimen-
sional fields by a minute crystalline pattern of frequency that represents one-
dimensional level of the personal or planetary morphogenetic field. This
minute crystalline structure is called a Morphogenetic Seed Crystal; it serves
to keep the multidimensional aspects of the identity connected to each other
and to the primary morphogenetic imprint within the D-8 Meta-galactic
Core.  
  There are 15 Morphogenetic Seed Crystals within the morphogenetic
structure of a planet or person, one corresponding to each of the 15 dimen-
sions. The Seed Crystals serve as seals that keep the morphogenetic field sep-
arated and locked into each dimensional band; thus we refer to them as Seed
Crystal Seals. The Seed Crystal Seals control the speed at which fourth-
dimensional Merkaba Fields will rotate, and so direct the pulsation rhythm of
particles within each dimension. Along with the Seed Crystal Seals there are
15 more minute patterns of crystallized morphogenetic frequency that exist
within the bio-energetic structure of a person or planet. Whereas the Seed
Crystal Seals set the morphogenetic field into the center of each dimension,
the other 15 seals are placed between dimensional bands and serve to regu-
late the function of the Seed Crystal Seals. The 15 morphogenetic seals exist-
ing between dimensional bands in the bio-energetic structure of a planet or
person are called  Star Crystal Seals or Fire Crystals.  The Star Crystal Seals

                                                                                                  Morphogenetic Crystal Seals
control the angle at which the Dimensional and Harmonic Merkaba Fields
will rotate, thus they direct the angular rotation of particle spin between the
dimensional bands of a forms particle construction. The Star Crystal Seals
control the operation of the Seed Crystal Seals in each dimension and can
release the Seed Crystal Seals, allowing the dimensionally separated portions
of the morphogenetic field to merge with each other.  
   The D-2 Orange-Gold Flame of Earth’ s morphogenetic field, the D-5 Blue
Flame of Tara’s morphogenetic field and the D-7 Violet Flame of Gaia’s mor-
phogenetic field, which we have previously discussed, represent three of the 15
planetary Morphogenetic Seed Crystal Seals which connect the planet to its
15-dimensional morphogenetic field. Earth-Tara-Gaia also has 15 Planetary
Star Crystal Seals, which exist within various locations throughout the 15-
dimensional universe, that keep the dimensional planetary particle fields sepa-
rate and regulate the angle of rotation of the planetary Dimensional Merkaba
Fields.  
    Planetary Star Crystal Seals regulate the evolution of planets and stars over
extensive periods of time, through directing the orbital patterns of planets, stars
and galaxies. The upcoming ascension period is possible precisely because of
the natural function of the Planetary and Galactic Star Crystal Seals. The
Planetary and Galactic Star Crystal Seals direct the angle of rotation of the
Universal Merkaba Fields, which allows the Dimensional Merkaba Fields of
Star Systems to come into direct alignment at certain times to form a Stellar
Spiral Bridge.  
   This process creates Stellar Spiral Alignments, such as the one Earth is
now approaching. During the Stellar Spiral Alignments the Morphogenetic
Seed Crystals of Earth, Tara and Gaia will temporarily release or open, allowing
the particle base of the planets to raise in pulsation rhythm for grid merger.
Through the Stellar Activations that will accompany the Stellar Spiral Align-
ments, higher-dimensional frequency from the Stellar Spirals will enter into
the Star Crystal Seals of the planets. The Planetary Star Crystal Seals will then
transmit this frequency into the Planetary Seed Crystal Seals that are located
within the centers of the primary vortex/portal systems of Earth, Tara and Gaia.
Through this energy infusion Earth’s particle base will be shifted into the
Bridge Zone time continuum. The Stellar Activation process works the same
way in relation to the human body.  
   The multidimensional bio-energetic field of the human, like that of a
planetary body, possesses 15 Seed Crystal Seals which control the pulsation
rhythms of the body’s multidimensional particle base. The human body is
connected to its HU-2 Soul Matrix, HU-3 Over-soul Matrix and Morphoge-
netic Identity of HU-4 and HU-5 through its 15 Seed Crystal Seals. The
human bio-energetic body also contains 15 Star Crystal Seals that control
475 
          

Ascension Cycle Dynamics   
the operation of the Seed Cr ystal Seals. The Seed Crystal Seals of the human
body are located at the center of the 15 primary chakra centers, nine of
which are located within the physical body structure.  
    Of the n ine embodied chakras, two are presently dormant; these will be
called into activation in humans participating in Stellar Activations. The six
remaining chakras exist within the bio-energetic field, some close to the
body, others extending outward into the galaxy. The six disembodied chakras
connect the human bio-energetic system and dimensional Merkaba Fields to
the Merkaba Fields of Earth and the Stellar Spirals. The disembodied higher
chakra centers will also be called into activation during Stellar Activations.
The human bio-energetic field also contains 15 Star Crystal Seals which con-
trol the function of the Seed Crystal Seals and the angle of rotation of the
personal Dimensional and Harmonic Merkaba Fields. Six of the Star Crystal
Seals are located outside of the body, nine are stationed within the body at
various levels of dimensional frequency.  
   The Star Crystal Seals of the human body are presently in a dormant
state, which keeps the Seed Crystal Seals of the chakra system closed, the
body’s particle base and consciousness separated and the personal Dimen-
sional Merkaba Fields locked into their respective dimensional frequency
bands. These conditions keep the human locked within the space-time coor-
dinates of Earth's present time cycle. For humans to shift out of the D-3 time
cycle and into the Bridge Zone with the majority of Earth’s particle base, the
human body must complete a minimum of 1.5 Stellar Activations. Through
the process of the first two Stellar Activations, two Star Crystal Seals will
activate and two Star Crystal Seals will release, allowing the particle pulsa-
tion rhythm of the three-dimensional human body to increase and the angu-
lar rotation of particle spin to shift into that of the HU-2 time cycles.  
     Each of the six Stellar Activations the Earth will encounter between
2000 and 2017 can also be achieved by humans upon the planet, because the
interdimensional Stellar Spirals come into alignment during this time period.
Each of the six Activations will activate various Star Crystals Seals within
the human body, if the human chakra system is used appropriately to draw in
frequency patterns and light spectra from the Stellar Spirals.  
     When the Star Crystal Seals activate, as a result of this infusion of fre-
quency, each progressively opens various Seed Crystal seals within the
chakras. Through this process, the HU-1 incarnate’s Merkaba Fields open
into and merge with the HU-2 soul matrix Merkaba Fields, allowing the
human body and consciousness to progressively transfer its particle content
out of HU-1 into HU-2, then from HU-2 into the Over-soul matrix of HU-3.
This is a complicated process of interdimensional energy dynamics. For our
discussion, it is enough for you to know that the Star Crystal Seals and Seed
Crystal Seals exist as part of your bio-energetic make up. These energy cen-

ters will be used during Stellar Wave Infusions and Activations, in order to
transmute the particle content of the body and consciousness out of the D-3
time cycles and into the HU-2 time cycles of Bridge Zone Earth or Tara .

       The Crystal Seals, Seed Codes, Fire Codes and The Silicate Matrix  
  The process of assembling DNA strands by working with the higher
chakras is the process of bringing frequency from the Stellar Spirals into the
Star Crystal Seals. There is an intimate relationship between the Seed Crys-
tal Seals, Star Crystal Seals and human DNA. Each Seed Crystal corresponds
directly to and controls the basic function of one strand of DNA. The foun-
dations of human DNA are minute templates of crystallized frequency—elec-
tro-tonal sound patterns and electromagnetic light spectra that magnetically
group into crystalline form. These minute, multidimensional crystalline tem-
plates are referred to as DNA seed codes . 
    Of the 15 Seed Crystal Seals within the bio-energetic body of the human,
12 Seed Crystal Seals governs the function of the DNA Seed Codes within
the 12-strand DNA imprint; one Seed Crystal Seal directs the Seed Code of
one strand of DNA. The Star Crystal Seals of the bio-energetic body also cor-
respond to the DNA. Within the morphogenetic imprint for human DNA
there are dormant gene codes that correspond to the Star Crystal Seals; as
long as the Star Crystal Seals are not activated, these gene codes will remain
dormant. Each Star Crystal Seal is composed of half of the frequency patterns
of the dimension above it and half of those from the dimension below.  
  There are 12 dormant DNA  codes corresponding to 12 Star Crystal
Seals and each code carries the frequencies and light spectra contained
within the Star Crystal Seal. These dormant gene codes allow for the sepa-
rate DNA strands to “plug into each other”, a condition necessary for Cellu-
lar Transmutation. The 12 dormant gene codes corresponding to 12 of the 15
Star Crystal Seals are individually referred to as Genetic Time Codes, Codes
of Transmutation or  Fire Codes . Collectively the 12 Fire Codes are known as
the Silicate Matrix  or the Crystal Gene. This is the original gene construc-
tion of the human organism.  
   Due to various genetic mutations, a very small percentage of humans
presently carry the entire Silicate Matrix in the personal morphogenetic
imprint for the DNA. Through distortions within the DNA Seed Codes, the
Fire Codes of the Silicate Matrix break down and can no longer function.
Without the functional Silicate Matrix, the Star Crystal Seals of the bio-
energetic body cannot activate and thus the body cannot achieve cellular
transmutation. Without operational Fire Codes, the body becomes locked
within its dimensional space-time station. The Fire Codes of the Silicate

Matrix are restored to f unction through correcting distortions within the
DNA Seed Codes; as the Seed Codes are repaired, the Fire Codes reassemble.
   During the upcoming ascension period and through the birth of the Six
Silent Ascension Avatars who will realign the DNA imprint, the distorted
DNA Seed Codes will be corrected in the race morphogenetic field, making
it possible for large numbers of people to reverse-mutate their DNA strands.
This reverse-mutation will allow for the Fire Codes of the Silicate Matrix to
begin re-assembly in people who do not carry this imprint, restoring the
body’s ability to activate the Star Crystal Seals and achieve cellular transmu-
tation.  
    This process will not take place automatically . It requires conscious par-
ticipation to prepare the body for these changes. The Higher Self and Soul
level aspects of personal identity will do much of the work, but the choices of
the conscious personality will have great bearing upon the outcome of these
multidimensional processes. Every thought and activity will either assist the
Higher Self in preparing for these changes or detract from its efforts to do so.
In subsequent books we of the Guardian Alliance will provide exercises
through which you can begin to consciously participate in this process. For
now we would simply like you to become acquainted with these hidden
dynamics of the science of ascension.

 1.    Seed Crystal Seals:  Minute crystalline frequency seals within each chakra
and auric field level of the 15-dimensional human bio-energetic field, that
keep particles and anti-particles in one dimension separated from each
other. Each Seed Crystal Seal corresponds to the frequency bands of one
dimension and directs the function of one DNA strand that corresponds
to that dimension. One Seed Crystal Seal separates the particle and anti-
particle units of the DNA strand, keeping the body’s particle base polar-
ized and locked into that dimensional band.  
The separation of particle and anti-particle caused by the Seed Crystal
Seal keeps the body’s particle base locked into the time continuum and
particle pulsation rhythm characteristic to that dimension. The Seed
Crystal Seals control particle pulsation rhythm, keeping it consistent with
the pulsation rhythm of the dimensional band in which the Seed Crystal
Seal is located. The Seed Crystal Seals control the speed at which the
Dimensional Merkaba Fields spin. Release of a Seed Crystal Seal allows
the particles and anti-particles of one dimension to fuse and to accelerate
in pulsation rhythm, causing the Dimensional Merkaba Field to accelerate
its speed of rotation.

When  the body’s particles in one dimension fuse and accelerate and the
rotation speed of the Merkaba Field increases, the Star Crystal Seal
between that dimensional band and the dimensional band above releases.
Seed Crystal Seals are considered Horizontal Seals, as they control the
horizontal movement of frequency bands, light spectra and particles in
one dimension. There are nine Seed Crystal Seals located at the center of
nine primary chakras within the structure of the physical body and six
located at the center of chakra centers outside of the physical body, for a
total of 15 Seed Crystal Seals within the design of multidimensional
human anatomy.  
2.   DNA Seed Codes—Base Codes And Acceleration Codes:  Units of
minute crystalline frequency that form the morphogenetic templates for
DNA strands. The template for one DNA strand is composed of 12 mag-
netic particle units and 12 electrical anti-particle units. The 12 magnetic
particle units are called Base Codes. The 12 electrical anti-particle units
are called Acceleration Codes.  
Each DNA strand is composed of the frequency patterns and light spectra
of one dimensional band. All aspects of human DNA are built upon this
morphogenetic template of 12 Base Codes and 12 Acceleration Codes.
The DNA Base Codes in one DNA strand represent the 12 magnetic base
tone frequencies of one dimension that corresponds to that strand and the
DNA Acceleration Codes represent the 12 electrical overtone frequencies
contained in one dimensional band. The electrical overtone frequencies
of a dimension correspond to the magnetic base tone frequencies of that
dimension's anti-particle counterpart in the parallel universe.  
The 24 Seed Codes of one DNA strand serve to set the body’s particle and
anti-particle content into the dimensional band corresponding to that
DNA strand, in both the particle and anti-particle universe. Each set of
Base Codes and Acceleration Codes in one DNA strand is controlled by
one Seed Crystal Seal, which serves to keep the particle Base Codes and
anti-particle Acceleration Codes of the DNA strand separate, thereby
maintaining the body’s particle base within the pulsation rhythms of that
dimension. Release of the Seed Crystal Seal allows Base Codes and Accel-
eration Codes in the DNA to fuse or “plug into each other” and accelerate
in pulsation rhythm. This allows the body’s particle and anti-particle base
in that dimension to fuse and accelerate in pulsation rhythm.  
The fusion of DNA Base Codes and Acceleration Codes causes minute
crystalline structures to manifest within the molecular structure of the
blood, which prepares the body’s bio-chemical, cellular, hormonal and
metabolic systems for acceleration of particle rhythm and transmutation.
Dimensional particle rhythm acceleration causes the Star Crystal Seal

between that dimension and the dimension above to release. Release of a
Star Crystal Seal activates a dormant Genetic Time Code or Fire Code
within the two DNA strands corresponding to that Star Crystal Seal.
3.   Star Crystal Seals: Minute crystalline frequency seals between chakras
and auric field levels within the 15-dimensional bio-energetic human
body, that keep particles and anti-particles from one dimensional band
separate from those in the dimensional bands above and below.
Each Star Crystal Seal corresponds to and is composed of the frequency
bands from the dimension above and from the dimension below the Star
Crystal Seal. The Star Crystal Seal directs the interaction between the
two DNA strands that correspond to the dimensions above and below the
Star Crystal Seal. One Star Crystal Seal separates the particles and anti-
particles in one dimension from the particles and anti-particles in the
dimension above, another separates the particles and anti-particles in that
dimension from those in the dimension below.
The Star Crystal Seals keep the particle fields of the three-dim ensional
body and multidimensional consciousness separate by controlling the
angular rotation of particle spin between the 15 dimensions. The separa-
tion of particle fields into three-dimensional groupings, which the Star
Crystal Seals create, keeps the particle content of the body locked into the
three-dimensional field of one Harmonic Universe. The Star Crystal Seals
control the angle at which the personal Dimensional Merkaba Fields will
rotate and thus also control the body’s relationship to the Harmonic
Merkaba Field (the three-dimensional Merkaba Field of one Harmonic
Universe). Release of a Star Crystal Seal allows the personal Dimensional
Merkaba Fields to align on a vertical axis with the Harmonic Merkaba
Field , which causes the Harmonic Merkaba Field rotation to accelerate,
aligning it with the Merkaba Field of the three-dimensional Harmonic
Universe above. Release of the Star Crystal Seal also allows the particles
and anti-particles in one three-dimensional field to merge, fuse and trans-
mute into the dimensional bands of the Harmonic Universe above.
As a Star Crystal Seal releases, a dormant DNA code called a Genetic
Time Code or ﬁre code activates within the two DNA strands correspond-
ing to the Star Crystal Seal. Star Crystal Seals are considered Vertical
Seals, as they control the vertical movement of frequency bands, light
spectra and particles between dimensions. There are nine Star Crystal
Seals located within the structure of the human body, and six located
within the multidimensional bio-energetic body (outside of the physical
structure), for a total of 15 Star Crystal Seals within the design of multidi-
mensional human anatomy.

  4.       DNA Fire Codes—Activation Codes:  Units of minute crystalline fre-
quency within the dimensional morphogenetic imprint for the DNA that
link DNA strands together and allow for cellular transmutation, teleporta-
tion, time travel and dimensional ascension to take place. Also referred to
as Codes of Transmutation or Genetic Time Codes. One DNA Fire Code
corresponds to each Star Crystal Seal. Each DNA strand contains half of
the Fire Code that corresponds to the Star Crystal Seal from the dimen-
sional band above the dimensional band to which the DNA strand corre-
sponds. It also contains half of the Fire Code corresponding to the Star
Crystal Seal from the dimensional band below that corresponding to the
strand.  
The DNA Fire Codes allow one DNA strand to “plug into” and fuse with
another. When DNA strands fuse, the Base Codes and Acceleration
Codes of one strand merge with those of the strand above, fusing particles
and anti-particles between dimensional bands. This allows the three parti-
cle bases of a three-dimensional human body to merge, the separation
between them dissolving. When the three-dimensional particle bases of a
body in one Harmonic Universe merge, the particles and anti-particles are
able to rapidly accelerate pulsation rhythm, turn into light waves and
transmute into the dimensional bands of the Harmonic Universe above.
The Fire Codes activate when their corresponding Star Crystal Seals
release.  
Once activated, the Fire Codes rapidly accelerate the assembly and activa-
tion of the Base Codes and Acceleration Codes of the strands to which
the Fire Code is attached. The Seed Crystal Seal in the next chakra up
then releases and particles and anti-particles within the dimensional band
corresponding to that Seed Crystal Seal fuse, activating the next Star
Crystal Seal. When the Fire Codes activate, the blood crystals (formed by
the release of successive Seed Crystal Seals), merge, forming complex
blood crystal structures, which carry the frequency patterns of three
dimensions. The three-dimensional blood crystals trigger further bio-
chemical, cellular, hormonal and metabolic acceleration. This biological
acceleration allows the body to raise the rhythm of particle pulsation and
shift the angular rotation of particle spin. The three smaller dimensional
Merkaba Fields of the body merge and open into the Harmonic Merkaba
Field, which then merges with the Harmonic Merkaba Field of the Har-
monic Universe above. The body cells accelerate, transmute into light
then re-manifest within the three-dimensional field of the Harmonic Uni-
verse above.  
There are 12 Fire Codes dormant within the original human 12-strand
DNA imprint, each corresponding to one of 12 Star Crystals. The 12 Fire
Codes are collectively referred to as the Silicate Matrix or Crystal Gene-
481
                                                                                                           
  
 

Ascension Cycle Dynamics  
the Gene of Transmutation. The  Fire Codes break down through distor-
tion in the DNA Seed Codes and become dysfunctional until the DNA
Seed Codes are realigned. The Star Crystal Seals of the bio-energetic body
cannot release unless the Silicate Matrix is operational.                              
                          DNA Mutations and the Ascension Cycle  
    Prior to mutation of the human genetic code, the process of Seed Crystal
Seal, Star Crystal Seal and Fire Code activation happened automatically as a
natural part of the biological evolutionary process. As the morphogenetic
field drew in frequency from the dimensional Uni fied Fields, progressively
assembling those frequencies into the DNA imprint then activating the
imprint through manifesting a corresponding DNA strand, the Seed Crystal
Seals would naturally release. Then the next Star Crystal Seal would release
and the DNA Fire Code would activate, progressively transmuting the cellu-
lar structure into less dense states of matter. The body systems were under
conscious control and the Immortal Human could choose desired time-space
placement by consciously altering the personal Merkaba Fields, bio-energetic
structure and particle pulsation rhythm. Presently these processes do not
operate as they were intended due to various DNA strand distortions and
mutations.  
  The coming ascension period of 2012-2017 offers humanity a rare
opportunity to rapidly reverse-mutate these genetic distortions, realign the
DNA imprint with its original 12-strand pattern and accelerate the evolution
of biology and consciousness by thousands of years. Humans who do not
make the shift to Bridge Zone Earth will not have this opportunity again, for
the Stellar Merkaba Spirals do not fully align with the Merkaba Fields of a
Descending planet. The DNA of humans on the Descending Phantom Earth
will undergo another mutation; the DNA will be unable to assemble beyond
the third strand and portions of the fourth strand that had begun to assemble
will dismantle and de-activate. This genetic mutation can be remedied only
through a Host Matrix Transplant, through which a Soul Matrix from HU-2
allows the HU-1 incarnate to energetically and genetically braid into its Soul
Matrix morphogenetic field. Individuals of Phantom Earth who do not have
Host Matrix Transplants will find their genetic codes, bodies and conscious-
ness deteriorating over several generations until the ability to reproduce is
lost. Cloning tactics further reduce the genetic imprint and ultimately will
not preserve the species. This is precisely the condition that occurred within
the Zeta race strains.  
  Due to the Stellar Spiral Alignments, Stellar Activations and Stellar
Wave Infusions of the ascension period, the process of cellular transmutation
can be brie ﬂy called into action. This will allow for a self-generated bio-ener-
getically induced transmutative evacuation from Phantom Earth to take
place, for those who participate in the Stellar Activation process. The DNA

                                                                                                                                DNA 101
strand mutations will be cleared from the race morphogenetic field of the
Sphere of Amenti and the corrected imprint will be transmitted through
Earth's grid into the bio-energetic fields of humans who have prepared their
system to receive these energies.  
       The frequencies carried on the Stellar Spirals can then create activation
and release of the Star Crystal Seals, which will allow the Seed Crystal Seals
to open and the DNA Fire Codes to activate. Through this Star Crystal Seal
Activation process, the particle pulsation rhythms of the body and conscious-
ness can be accelerated and the DNA rapidly assembled and activated, so
individuals may shift into the Bridge Zone or Taran time cycles. Each of the
upcoming six Transmutative Stellar Activations will allow various Star Crys-
tal Seals to release and DNA strands to activate. A minimum of 1.5 Stellar
Activations must occur for an individual to successfully shift into the Bridge
Zone. Those who do not make the shift will end up on Phantom Earth in the
D-3 time cycle after 2017. Reincarnation out of HU-1 will require a Host
Matrix Transplant.  
      Releasing of the Star Crystal Seals of the human body is a complicated
process of multidimensional physics. We do not have enough time to teach
you of the intricacies involved in this process. For this reason our future work
will focus upon bio-energetic techniques you can use to facilitate the process,
rather than on laborious conceptual foundations such as those presented in
this book. It is important that you comprehend the basic concepts of these
energetic dynamics so future exercises will make some bit of rational sense to
you. To take this opportunity for accelerated evolution, you simply need to
know how to use your mind to direct frequency. You also need to know what
frequencies are available at what times via the Stellar Spirals, how to bring
these frequencies into your bodies and where to direct them once you have
drawn them in.  
     Frequencies from the Stellar Spirals are drawn into your body via the
higher-dimensional chakras; the chakra centers located outside of the body
that are primarily dormant at this time and do not transmit frequency directly
into the lower, in-body chakras. By intention you can use the Stellar Spiral
frequencies to activate these higher chakra centers, then draw energy from
the Spirals through the activated chakras into the lower chakras and the
appropriate Star Crystal Seals.

Ascension Cycle Dynamics
                                           You must know:
   A. What Stellar Spirals carry what frequencies and when the Spiral aligns with Earth,
                                         making those frequencies available.
 
  B. Where your higher and lower chakras and Star Crystal Seals are located, what
 frequencies each chakra can draw in and how the chakras correspond to the Star Crystal
                                                    Seals you need to activate.
    The in-body chakras of 1-7 correspond to the frequency bands of dimen-
sions 1-7. The higher-dimensional chakras that correspond to dimensions 9-
15 are called Morphogenetic Chakras, as they open into and draw energy
from the morphogenetic fields of dimensions 1-7, which are correspondingly
located in dimensions 9-14.  
    The lower dimensions and chakras are linked to the higher dimensions
and morphogenetic chakras through the Meta-galactic Core at D-8 and the
eighth chakra; the activated eighth chakra allows you to draw frequency from
the morphogenetic chakras down into the lower chakra centers.  
   T o activate certain Star Crystal Seals you will open the morphogenetic
chakra that corresponds to the lower chakras with which that Seal is associ-
ated, then draw frequency from the morphogenetic chakra into the Star
Crystal Seal.  
     It is not difficult to do once you understand the correspondences between
the lower chakras, their Star Crystal Seals and the morphogenetic chakras.

     FIELD TECHNIQUE 1: EXERCISE TO RELEASE CRYSTALLIZED
                        THOUGHT PATTERNS FROM THE DNA
                           AND CELLULAR MEMORY IMPRINT
• By moving the focus of your conscious attention into a slower-moving pul-
     sation pattern, you will be able to release the thought patterns stored with-
     in your cells. When you relax your mental focus and slow your heart and
     breathing rates, your consciousness expands and begins to pulsate faster,
     while the pulsation rhythm of your body’s particles slows. From this
     quickened state of consciousness, you can then consciously shift the par-
     ticle-pulsation speed of your awareness into very slow pulsation rhythms.
• First, you will visualize moving your consciousness through a dark tunnel, with a
bright light at its end (the same effect as in a Near Death Experience, which
occurs for the following reason). Moving into the light represents the
quickening of the particle pulsation rhythm of your consciousness, for
which you are aiming in this exercise. You perceive the “dark tunnel” as
your consciousness moves from its D-4 pulsation rhythm, through  the 90°
shift in angular rotation of particle spin that exists between the D-4 and
D-5 frequency bands, and into the faster pulsation rhythms of D-5 fre-
quency. The “light at the end of the tunnel” represents the collective re-
ality fields of the D-5 frequency bands, (and the D-5 consciousn ess
contained there within), as viewed in condensed form, by consciousness
stationed in lower dimensions. One moves closer to the light as the par-
ticle pulsation rhythm of the consciousness accelerates to the rhythm of
the D-5 frequency bands. The light will appear to take on spherical form,
like a blazing sun, as the consciousness nears the D-5 pulsation rhythm.
One merges with the light when the consciousness has reached D-5 pul-
sation rhythm. This is the process you will encounter after death, but it
can be used consciously while you are still in body, for many different pur-
poses. When you perceive the light you are seeing the fifth dimension.
• Once visualizing yourself in the light, submerge yourself within it and feel that light
         move through every cell in your body, imagine it moving through your DNA.
      This raises the pulsation rhythm of the body’s particles by infusing them

    Field Techniques
within the D-5 frequency patterns carried by your accelerated conscious-
ness, bringing what is stored within the cells closer to the range of your
conscious perception. When you view your body from this D-5 state of
consciousness, you will notice areas of the body that appear quite light
filled, and others that appear dark. The dark areas represent parts of the
body in which slower-pulsating particles are stored, the dark areas are the
karmic imprints you seek to release.
•  Next, move your attention into one of the dark areas as fully as possible, feel its
sensations and become aware of the pulsation rhythm of the energy in that inter-
nal space. It will have a distinct feel of rhythm that you can detect if you
move your attention into i t.
• Become aware of the difference between the pulsation rate of your con-
sciousness and that of the dark area, then  consciously slow the pulsation rate
of your consciousness to match that of the dark area. Feel yourself moving
down into the blackness of the dark space, slowing the rhythm of your
consciousness, spreading out, and becoming one with the area. As you
proceed to move your consciousness into the area, you will feel a distinct
sensation of the stopping of expansion. This occurs when your conscious-
ness has fully expanded itself into the morphogenetic field of t hat dark
area thought-form. You have become one with the thought pattern, you
are the pattern. You do not have to identify the contents of the thought
pattern in order to release it, though you may begin to receive ideas, im-
ages or emotional qualities from the thought-form as you proceed through
this exercise. Let the impressions pass by your attention, and keep focused
on the exercise. In merging your awareness with the dark thought-form,
you have moved the station of your consciousness from the D-4 level,
through the D-5 level and down into the frequency bands in which that
thought-form originated. You have entered its source of creation and
merged your identity with that of the identity who created the pattern.
You have become the creator of the thought pattern. Being its creator, you
can now change it.¹
• Once you have become one with the crystallized thought-form, sense the
    shape and boundaries of its energy structure. It will have a form and struc-
    ture of energy that you can “feel out” with your consciousness.
• Feel your awareness expand into every layer of the energy form, as if you are fill-
    ing a balloon with water or a box with sand, until you can feel your con-
    sciousness take up every inch of area within the structure of the thought-
    form. Once you feel completely expanded into the thought-form, begin
    to recreate it.
    ___________________________________
1.      Note : Having the ability to consciously shift your entire awareness into the D-5 level is                  
         an attribute of complete fifth DNA strand assembly and activation, which most humans
         do not yet possess. When you use your present imagination to create the inner experience
         of this merger, you actually accelerate the assembly of strands four and five and rapidly
         increase your accretion level. The more you practice such exercises, the more your aware-
         ness will be able to access the D-5 pulsation rhythm, which will make the D-5 merger pro-                                                                                                                                                        
                    gressively more tangible and “real” in terms of physical perception and embodiment of D-
         5 frequency. Any exercises that mentally “take you into the light" will do this for you.

     Field Technique 1: Exercise to Release Crystallized Thought Patterns
• Call light to yourself. Imagine that you can see light streaming in from a beam
       above you, as if there was a sun positioned above your consciousness.
• Breathe light from that sun, into your consciousness and feel it make the pulsation
rhythm of the thought-form and your consciousness move faster. See the dark
area that is presently “you” become more and more light filled. Begin to
hear the sound pitch of the energy in the thought-form and hear its fre-
quency raise, as more and more light enters the thought-form. Allow the
sound and sensation of expanding light to fill your entire consc iousness,
and continue to draw light in, until you sense a distinct stop to the sensa-
tion of light expanding. The thought-form has now reached its maximum
holding capacity for UHF energy.
• Now, imagine that the sun above you is moving down, into your consciousness
 and the thought-form. When the sun enters the thought-form, the thought-
form explodes and the crystalline energy substance, of which its morpho-
genetic field was made, literally blows apart. The thought-form no longer
exists as a reality within your body or consciousness, its particles of energy
substance have been released. The energetic reality of this process is that
of using inner light (visualizations) to guide UHF sound patterns into a
thought-form morphogenetic field. The UHF sound patterns literally
shatter the energy structure of the thought-form, breaking apart the crys-
tallization of slower-pulsating energy particles, just as certain tones of
sound can cause a glass to shatter in the physical world. Through engaging
in this process, you are literally merging the slower-pulsating crystallized
particles with their anti-particles, through the thought-form of the sun
that you created during the visualization. That “sun” image translates
through your body consciousness as D-5 through D-8 frequency, the fre-
quency bands of transmutation through which particle and anti-particle
merge. When you merge multidimensional particles and anti-particles you
create photons. Through this exercise you have created a burst of photo-
nic energy within the frequency bands in which the thought-form crystal-
lization had been.
• To conclude this exercise , focus upon the image of the sun causing the thought-
 form to explode. Imagine that you can feel this explosion within your body as a
 sudden burst of energy that runs through your cells from the area in the body
 where the dark area had been. Visualize this occurring, and see that the dark area
 is now ﬁlled with radiating light. You may not have to imagine the sensation
 of energy rushing through you at all, for this is the energetic reality of what
 is taking place. The degree to which you can sense this energy release will
   depend upon how sensitized your neurological structure is to higher fre-
    quency energy. This sensitivity will increase the more you engage your
  consciousness in activities such as this exercise. Exercises like this activate
 dormant DNA codes, which program the body to build new neuro-pas-
 sageways and nerve endings. This increases the body’s ability to sense sub-  
   tle energy and expands the perceptual range of consciousness while it is                                        
 focused in the body.  
 
  • As you visualize photonic light running through your body , consciously guide
       that light directly into the DNA, while holding the intention that the body will
       use this energy to accelerate the DNA-building process, under the direction of

the soul matrix identity. Visualize minute photonic particles moving into and ad-
hering to your double helix DNA strands, until you perceive all of the light par-
ticles that were released, as merging with your DNA.
• Complete the exercise  by visualizing your consciousness returning into the bright
 light sun, then move your awareness backward through the dark tunnel until it
 is focused in your present moment station of consciousness.
                    FIELD TECHNIQUE 2: THE MAHARIC SEAL
• The teachings of the Guardian Alliance are vested in the Law of One; the
interconnection, and Interdependence , of all dimensions of “reality”...
and the Living God, or Spirit, alive within all things.
• All Guardian Alliance teachings are “state of the art,” and specifically ac-
knowledge the scientific/ energetic foundations of “Oneness,” together
with clear emphasis on the unification of science with Spirit, t he “Chris-
tos Within,” and the absolute association with Esoteric Metaphysical Or-
der.
• The practical purpose of these teachings is to truly free and empower all,
through expanded consciousness and educated enlightenment, through
which reverence, respect, love and co-operative co-creation are fostered
within the Global Community. These perspectives fully embrace geo-
physical planetary healing as an intrinsic consequence of personal align-
ment and expansion.
• The personal-planetary technique given here is a key-stone tool of such im-
portance that it is made freely available to everyone. Like all Temple tech-
niques and tools, the Maharic Seal is grounded firmly in Univers al
Unified Field physics, ancient Merkaba Mechanics and Matter Template
Science (a.k.a. the “Divine Blueprint”).
•These techniques are known as “ Bio-Regenesis Technologies"  which were once
 common knowledge, taught in the Pre-Ancient Mystery Schools of ad-
 vanced human cultures; these were regarded as standard, as well as essen-
 tial, daily practice.
• The Maharic Seal , like all Bio-Regenesis Technologies , implies application of
speciﬁc conscious energy, directed to, and within, the core manifestation
template of the body. This technique directly activates the specific math-
ematical -geometrical relationship within, and between, the  Angelic Hu-
man and the planetary, organic, evolutionary blueprint utilizing the
hydroplasmic frequencies of the 10th, 11th and l2th Dimensional “ Maha-
ra Current .” The Maharic Current was fully re-anchored on this planet for
the first time in about 210,000 years, at the GRU-AL point, Sarasota, FL,
Signet 2 point of the Planetary Templar Grid, on May 5, 2000.
• The Maharic Seal  is a major tool by which the purpose, intention, awareness
   and effect of the Angelic Human  can be significantly accelerated in a gen-
   uine, substantial and high impact fashion.

                             Regular use o f the Maharic Seal will:
• Begin the process of activating the 8th through 12th chakras of the personal
     Kathara Grid;
• Assist the opening of Crystal Seals in the body (which otherwise block
    DNA activation);
• Open the Planetary Bio/Feed Interface within the personal body, enabling
  the body vehicle to become a truly effective tool for lasting, planetary  grid
  and sacred site work;
• Trigger DNA activations which progressively and automatically activate
       the full Merkaba;
• Enable healers to transmit 12D frequency sub-harmonics, providing more
       powerful, longer lasting (often permanent) healing facilitation -free of
       personal and client energetic field distortions;
• Protect users from “disharmonic” energies associated with “channeling,”
       healing, Astral projection, and other means of personal field infiltration;
• Assist Indigo Type III children anchor the higher frequencies which cause
       fractious behavior (administered via parent);
• Amplify the results of spiritually focused activity;
• Harmonize personal & environmental energies;
• Create Morphogenetic Re-patterning , clearing karmic / miasmic imprints                           
   which otherwise block DNA activation (and the attainment of true con-
     sciousness expansion and full embodiment of the "Christos Principle'');
• Realign, revitalize and regenerate all aspects of the physical and subtle body
      systems;
• Trigger activation of 11th and 12th sub-harmonics in every DNA strand
 which assists correction of code reversal and the effects of interaction with
 other code mutated partners;
• Prepare and equip practitioners to receive and hold the increas ing ﬂow of
 higher frequency energies ﬂowing into the Planetary Grids and personal
 morphogenetic fields arising from the intensifying Stellar Activation Cy-
 cle now underway (2000-20l7).

Temporary Maharic Seal Technique Steps
   Short Version of the Maharic Seal™ Bio-field Clearing, Alignment and Pro-

      Program . For temporary restoration and maintenance of personal Bio-
      Field Integrity and Physical Revitalization.
                                                                                                                                                      
  Prior to use: Read through  the steps and practice the visualizations and their se-
      quence slowly,  for familiarity.
1. Imagine the two-dimensional image of a “Merkaba Star” or six-pointed
        “Star of David,” in the color of Pale Silver, as if the image is drawn on a
  black background on the inside of your forehead. This image represents a
  composite scalar wave pattern Keylontic Symbol Code called the “Hi-
  erophant.” Its color denotes the frequency spectra of the 11th and 12th
  Dimensions, and its form, combined with these color frequencies, repre-
  sents the control code of the l2th dimensional frequency band. It is the
  Key Code to unlock the 12th Dimensional Maharic Shield in the personal
  and planetary scalar grids.
2. Inhale , while visualizing the Hierophant Symbol at the center of the brain,
       in the Pineal Gland.
3. Exhale, while using the exhale breath to firmly move the Hierophant down
        the Central Vertical Body Current (energy current in the center of the
        body), then out between the legs and straight down into the Earth’s core
        (your 13th Chakra).
4. Inhale, while imagining that you can see at Earth’s core a huge, Disc-shaped
         Crystalline Platform of Pale Silver Light that extends outward on a hori-
zontal plane through the entire body of the Earth and out into the atmo-
sphere. Visualize the Hierophant suspended in the center of the disc (this
image represents the Planetary Maharic Shield, the scalar wave grid com-
posed of dimension 10/11/12 frequency, with the Hierophant Key Code
positioned to activate the Planetary Shield.)
5. Exhale,  while pushing your breath outward into the Earth’s Maharic Shield,
          imagining as you exhale that the force of the breath has made the Earth’s
          Maharic Shield begin to spin.
6. Inhale,  using the inhale breath to draw Pale Silver Light from Earth’s spin-
        ning Maharic Shield into the Hierophant positioned at the center of the
        Planetary Shield.
7. Exhale,  using the exhale breath to push the Pale Silver Light throughout the
        entire Hierophant making the Hierophant glow and pulsate with Pale Sil-
        ver Light.
8. Inhale, imagine that the glowing Pale Silver Hierophant momentarily ﬂash-
        es Crimson Red and returns to Pale Silver. Then use the inhale breath to
       draw the Hierophant vertically up from its position at Earth’s core, to a po-
       sition 12" below your feet (the position of your dormant personal Maharic
       Shield scalar-wave grid). As you inhale the Hierophant upward from
       Earth’s core, imagine that it trails a thick cord of Pale Silver Light behind
       it. Qne end of the Silver Cord remains attached to Earth’s core, the other
       attached to the Hierophant (the Cord represents an “Energy Feed Line”  
     499                                                                                                      
                                                                                                 
  
                                                                                                                        

  
Field Techniques
      through which you will draw energy up from the Earth’s Maharic Shield
      into your personal Maharic Shield)
9.   Exhale,  with your attention on the Hierophant positioned 12" below your
      feet and use the exhale breath to push a burst of Pale Silver Light outward
on a horizontal plane from the Hierophant. Imagine that a Disc-shaped,
Crystalline Platform of Pale Silver Light about 4' in diameter, extends on
 a horizontal plane 12" beneath your feet around the Hierophant at its cen-
 ter. (This image represents your personal Maharic Shield.)
10. Inhale,  while using the inhale breath to draw more Pale Silver Light up
   through the Pale Silver Cord from Earth’s Core, into the Hierophant at
   the center of your personal Maharic Shield.
     
11.  Exhale,  using the exhale breath to push the Pale Silver Light from the Hi-
          erophant, out into your Maharic Shield. Imagine that your Maharic
          Shield now pulsates, as it fills with the Pale Silver Light from Earth’s Core.
12.  Inhale,  again drawing more Pale Silver Light up from Earth’s Core through
      the Pale Silver Cord into the Hierophant, and imagine the Pale Silver
      Cord expanding to four feet in width, forming a Pillar of Silver Light run-
      ning up from Earth’s Core directly into your four-foot-diameter Maharic
      Shield.
  13.  Exhale,  again using the exhale breath to push Pale Silver Light from the
        Hierophant outward into your Maharic Shield, while imagining that your
     Maharic Shield “takes on a life of its own,” the disc suddenly “folding
     upward ” with a “ popping ” sensation, to form a 4' diameter pillar of Pale
     Silver Light all around and running through your body.2
 14.  Inhale,  imagining that the inhale breath draws the Pale Silver Light from
      the Pillar encasing the body into every body cell. Sense the tingling feel-
      ing as the Pale Silver Light moves through the physical body.
 15.  Exhale, imagining that you can feel the energy of the Pale Silver Light ex-
       panding into every cell of the body and then outward around the body
       into the Bio-field.
   16.  Breathe naturally for a minute or two, as the feeling of the Pale Silver Light
      moves through you, while sensing the energy presence of the Maharic Seal
      Pale Silver Pillar 4' around your body. The more time you spend breathing
      and sensing the energies, the more dimension 10/11/12 frequency you are
      drawing into your Pillar, which will increase the length of time the Maha-
      ric Seal Pillar will remain in your Bio-field.
 17.  Return your attention to the Hierophant still positioned 12" below your
        feet.
18.  Inhale , using the inhale breath to draw the Hierophant up through your
       Central Vertical Body Current, then out the top of your head (the 7th
       “Crown” Chakra), to a point about 36" above the head (the 14th Chakra).
_______________________
 2.    This is your Maharic  seal, a temporary scalar-wave pillar of dimension 10/11/12 frequency
         light that blocks out disharmonic frequencies from dimensions 1 through 12 and begins to
         realign disharmonic frequencies in your body and bio-fi eld to their original perfect natural
         order.

                                                             The Personal and Planetary Maharic Shields Chart
19.   Exhale for cefully , using the exhale breath to rapidly expand the Hi-
     erophant outward on a horizontal plane at the 14th Chakra, until the Hi-
     erophant suddenly “disappears” from view, with a mild “popping”
     sensation.
20.  Breathe normally, while visualizing for a moment a brilliant 4' Pale Silver
     Pillar of Light extending from the Earth’s Core upward, fully encasing
     your body and extending far above the head, into Earth’s atmosphere and
     to a single Star of Pale Blue Light far off in deep space. Your Maharic
     Shield is now temporarily activated, and your Maharic Seal Pillar is tem-
     porarily manifest within your Bio-Field. The Maharic Seal will remain in
     your Bio-field anywhere from 20 minutes to 1 hour at first. The more this
     exercise is practiced, the longer the Pillar will remain.
21.   For quick reinforcement of the Maharic Seal, once the full process has
     been run within 24 hours: Simply imagine a spark of Pale Silver Light at
     the Pineal Gland, exhale it rapidly down to Earth’s Core and imagine the
     Earth’s Maharic Shield spinning. Call to mind the Pale Silver Cord and
     inhale the 4' diameter Cord all the way up around you, forming the Pillar,
     attaching it “out in deep space” to the Star of Pale Blue Light.
• The Short Version of this technique provides a “manually created” tempo-
     rary Maharic Seal in your Bio-Field, and requires manual resetting every
     24 hours, with frequent reinforcement during the day. Using and practic-
     ing the full version of this technique, as described in the Kathara Bio-Spir-
     itual Healing SystemTM Level-l  Maharic Recoding Process TM, will
     progressively program the Cellular Memory of the body to hold the Ma-
     haric Seal for prolonged periods of time. With consistent practice of the
     full technique, over an extended period of time, the Maharic Seal will
     function automatically as a permanent fixture within your B io-field.
• In the meantime, the Short Version of this technique, coupled with rein-
     forcement throughout the day, will provide Bio-field protection and gen-
     tle, regenerative Core Template realignmen t for all aspects of the
     physical and Subtle-Energy-Body- systems. It is recommended to use at
     least this Short Version of the Maharic Seal technique prior to ANY en-
     ergy work, “channeling,” or Astral and Dream Projection. It will not only
     provide protection from disharmonic energies; it will also amplify the re-
     sults you desire to gain from these activities.

                         Field Techniques
                 FIELD TECHNIQUE 3: THE MAHARIC QUICK SEAL
1.  Work with a 24 pointed, 3 Dimensional Star (Hierophant) and be aware
       that you will be working with beings known as the Breneau Rishi.
2.  Begin by slowing your breathing, as you imagine or visualize a 24 point, 3-
       Dimensional, Hierophant at the Pineal Gland in the center of your brain.
       Visualize the Hierophant surrounded by a Pale Blue Sphere of Light.
(The Blue Sphere serves as a buffer for your readiness to accept the frequencies
       associated with using the 24 pointed Star; the Blue Sphere holds the en-
       ergy for you until your body can handle the energy. If you can handle it,
       the energy will simply pass through the blue sphere).
3. Inhale,  as if you are going to grab the Blue Sphere containing the 24 point
       star located at the Pineal, and on the Exhale move the 24 point star/ Blue
       Sphere, all the way down to Earth’s Core. Try to hear a sound tone as the
       Hierophant/ Sphere hits the Planetary Shields.
4. Inhale  and draw the Hierophant/ sphere up to your Personal Maharic Shield
       12" below your feet. . .and Exhale  while watching the Pale Silver-Blue
       sphere expand out to a large sphere. . .and watch as your Maharic Shield
       pops out as a disc, about 4' in diameter, Pale Silver with a light coating of
       Pale Blue.
5. Bring your attention to the center of your Maharic Shield 12" below your
       feet. . .and Inhale the 24 point Star (only) up into the Heart Chakra. Ex-
       hale , expanding the frequencies of the 24 point Star into the Heart
       Chakra.
6. Inhale  to grab the 24 point Star, and exhale , pushing the Star up into the
       14th Chakra 36" above the head. Imagine that the 24 point Star is spin-
       ning in a clockwise direction in the 14th Chakra. As you do this, try to
       feel/sense the energy around you, just a few inches out from your body.
7. Now, put your attention into your Maharic Shield 12" below your feet, take
       a couple of relaxing breaths and inhale deeply pulling the Pale Silver and
       Blue energy up, as if you are pulling on your Maharic Seal to latch it on to
       your 14th Chakra. Try and feel the sensations just a few inches from your
       body now-feel the difference if you can. This procedure gives you a Quick
       Seal.
8. Now envision the cord of Pale Silver Maharic Light that would normally
       come up with your Shield and focus on the Earth’s Core. Begin drawing
       energy all the way up the 4” diameter cord and into the body.  Inhale  the
       energy up into the Heart Center, and expand it there. Begin to form a Pale
       Silver ball of Maharic frequency.
On each exhale  send your energy down to the Earth’s Core to bring up another
       load of Maharic frequency, up from the Planetary Shields, expand it into
       the Heart center and repeat several times. Notice that the Cord grows
       larger as you do this, expanding from approximately 4" to 6 to 8" diameter,
       until finally it feels like a skin around (as well as wit hin) your body. . .as
       you load your Astral field with Maharic Frequency.

9. Move your attention to the Pale Silver ball you have created in your Heart
Center,  inhale  and move it up to the 14th Chakra 36" above your head. . .as
you do, feel for the sheath of Maharic Frequency encasing your etheric
body, close to your skin. ɜ

                                    “Pillar of First Cause/ Eckatic Light”
1. One Breath + three
       Breath 1—Visualize Hierophant Symbol Code  at the Pineal Gland.  Inhale,
             then exhale forcefully , moving the Symbol Code down the Central
           Body Current  and into Earth’s core
    Three  breaths —Take 3 full breaths, and on each exhale  push firmly into
               the Symbol Code at the Earth’s core, making the Symbol Code spin,
               and visualize each breath expanding into a huge spinning DISC of
               Pale Silver Light , in the center of the Earth; the disc spins, moving
               faster with each breath.4
2. One Breath—On the next  inhale , draw the spinning Symbol Code up to 12"
        below the feet , visualizing a 4' diameter tube  of Pale Silver Light trailing
        from Earth’s core... following the Symbol Code. Exhale , and push the
        spinning disc of Pale Silver Light  outward, 12" beneath the feet.  This is your
        personal Maharic Shield.
       
       Three breaths —Take 3 breaths, and on each exhale , push the breath out-
             ward into the disc making the disc spin faster.
3. One Breath + three  
      
      Breath l— On the inhale,  draw a large amount of Pale Silver Energy up
     through the tube- from the Earth’s core, and exhale  this energy into the
     Maharic Shield  DISC , 12" beneath your feet. Visualize the disc “pop-
     ping ” into a Vertical Pillar of Pale Silver Light  - completely surrounding,
     and penetrating,  your body; while connecting with the Silver  tube,  to   
     form a large tube/pillar  of Light  extending from the Earth’s core. . .up
     into the Earth’s atmosphere to a pale blue speck of Light at the center
     of the sun; aligns with the Eckatic Level of the Energy Matrix. Visu-
     alize your body as being sealed within  the Silver Pillar - this is your Per-
     sonal Maharic Seal.
        
       Three breaths—Take 3 breaths; on the  inhale  draw energy up from Earth’s
                 core to the 4th Heart Chakra.  On the exhale,  push the breath from the
                 Heart Chakr a into the tube of Pale Silver Light around you; each
                 Breath making the Pillar appear brighter and stronger.___________________________________________________________
3.       This Maharic/ Christos skin charges and saturates your etheric body. Try to feel the peace-
          fulness and all-knowing nature of this frequency.
4.       This is the Earth’s Maharic Shield—the Shield of Aramatena.

  Field Techniques
3. One breath —Take a slow, full, inhale  drawing a thick current of energy up
from Earth’s core to the Heart Chakra . Then, exhale sharply, directing the
breath energy to a point at the center of the group circle.5 As you exhale , vi-
sualize your Pillar replicating . One Pillar remains around you,6 and another
replica  expands outward around the entire group. Visualize a large Silver
disc growing  out from the group center point , 12 ” beneath the surface you are
standing on , forming a platform upon  which the group stands. This is the
group Maharic Shield, through  which the Um Shaddai Ur Pillar will electro
  magnetically ground into Earth’s Maharic Shield.
  4. Three breaths : Take three final breaths, and with each one, inhale and visu
          alize a stream of Pale Silver energy coming up through the feet from
          earth’s core and simultaneously down from the Sun through the top of the
          head. . .the two streams of energy meeting to form one thick Silver stream
         at the Heart Chakra. Exhale  Maharic frequency into the group center
         point.
    After the third energizing breath, simply breathe normally, as each exhale
moves energy into the group center point. Stand with the group for a
few moments and visualize the Um Shaddai Ur Pillar of Light emanat
ing from the Sun, through the group Pillar and group Maharic
Shield. . .and into the Earth core Maharic Shield

                            Intruder  ET and Illuminati Races of the 2001 UIR OWO Team Summary Chart Introduction.
                                                   Illuminati Hybrid Humans, Unity-Through-Diversity and Reclaiming Christos Potentials
  ''Primary Leviathan Illuminati Races ''/'' Human Tribe Infiltration '' refer to Illuminati hybrid race imposters         
within a given HumanTribe, and select family lines within a given Human Tribe that have been genetically    
compromised by Illuminati-hybrid interbreeding. These categories do not imply that named ethnic af ﬁliations    
are dominated by Intruder race genetic distortion; Illuminati ( non-human Intruder race souls) and In ﬁltrated     
family lines (Human souls, Intruder DNA attachments) make up the minority  in each Human ethnic group.    
Understanding the common problem  of Intruder race in ﬁltration now shared by all human cultures  should     
 allow for the advancement of a common ground problem-solving Human Unity Through Recognized      
Diversity , built upon inter-racial equality, respect, love and compassion. This knowledge IS NOT an    
excuse  to apply the Anti-Christos hatred creeds  of bigotry, race supremacy or prejudice against any      
lineage.  If successful in their “First Contact” invasion plan, the UIR intend to use “contrived historical and    
distorted genealogical” falsiﬁed “evidence ” to indicate that all Human races are a “common genetic lineage”    
derived from their combined Anunnaki-Sirian and Drakonian-Reptilian “stock”. This False Human Unity     
promotion  is intended to vanquish true Angelic Human Race identity  and obscure Illuminati-hybrid    
presence  to prepare us all for a “common uni ﬁed takeover” under a false UIR  “Creator God” platform. TRUE    
Human Unity  will be gained through loving identi ﬁcation of the Species Diversity  that exists within the     
“Common Chemical Clothing” of the “contemporary Human form”. Il luminati and in ﬁltrated Human family lines      
can make the choice to refuse Intruder association and opt for Emerald Covenant DNA Template Bio-           
Regenesis to continue their evolutionary path toward Christed Mastery, if they are aware of the evolutionary     
challenges and required solutions posed by Intruder race genetic connection.  Angelic Human/Indigo,       
Illuminati and In ﬁltrated races can all evolve to genuine “Christed Race” status and freedom . Due to                                                                
inherent genetic and Core Template differences, each group requires a different evolutionary path  by which     
the DNA Template, bio-energetic ﬁeld and consciousness template can reclaim the Base-12/D-12 Pre -matter    
“Divine Blueprint ” template coding required to attain genuine biologically based “ Christed Avatar     
Consciousness ”/ minimum 12-Strand DNA Template  potential. If the diversity within the illusion of the      
“Common Human Genome” is not recognized, all races will remain trapped within the present state       
of Common Race De-Evolution  through which the Christiac genetic potentials within each di versiﬁed race will     
become lost in progressive degeneration to race extinction.                
Most Human beings of Illuminati and In ﬁltrated Human race descent have no consciousness knowledge of      
their connection to Fallen Angelic Intruder ET races; nor are they aware that their genetic signature pre-      
disposes them to Intruder manipulation. This physical/emotional/mental/spiritual vulnerability to Intruder     
manipulation can be overcome if the individual comprehends the importance of utilizing genuine Founders     
Inner Christos Spiritual-Science teachings and technologies. Inner Christos D-12 Divine Blueprint sciences     
and Maharic Bio-Regenesis Technologies are the only methods by which regeneration of the DNA Strand      
Template–12 personal D-12 Pre-matter Divine Blueprint can occur to restore the individual’s direction      
connection to its D-12 Christos Avatar Identity. The Founder’s Bio-Spiritual Technologies allow the original    
connection to the Primal Light/Sound Fields to be restored  via reactivation of the 9-dimensional      
Antahkarana-Kundalini Cord  and 12-Dimensional Maharata Cord  Primal Life Force Currents.  Genetically    
vulnerable humans and Illuminati hybrids are loved by God/Source just as much as any other race  and can    
regain their freedom, free will, Bio-Spiritual Integrity and genuine Christos potential  through entering a    
chosen path of conscious evolution  built upon the genuine Founders Inner Christos spiritual/science     
teachings . Illuminati and in ﬁltrated races are victims to Intruder exploitation just as are Angelic Human and     
Indigo race lines. Like numerous Fallen Angelic races, Illuminati human-hybrid races can evolve beyond    
exploiting, abusive behaviors ; they need Love  (Tough Love  usually works better than Soft Love, which     
fallen races tend to exploit), Healing  and Inner Christos Spiritual  education , not judgment, condemnation     
and destruction, to reset and develop the Christos Potentials within themselves.

                         Amenti Opening Schedule            
      Due to the Sept 12, 2000 Fallen Angelic /Intruder ET United Resistance Illuminati     
  Edict of War and United Resistance’s intention of orchestrating Earth Templar takeover    
  and pole shift by 2008, Guardian nations issued an Imminent Crisis Order in October    
  2000, setting in motion the Emerald Covenant Masters Planetary Stewardship Initiative.    
  As per this Crisis Intervention Program, Sirius B Star Gate-6 and the D-12 Halls of    
  Amorea Passage were activated seven years early in May 2001. Advanced Planetary Tem-    
  plar RRTs are now being conducted, in effort to achieve Planetary D-12 Maharic Seal    
  Protection of Earth’s Templar and populations before Aug12, 2003. Early activation of D-    
  6 Sirius B Star Gate-6 and continued United Resistance Templar Quest sonic pulse activ-    
  ity has greatly accelerated the rate of frequency infusion into Earth’s Planetary Shields,    
  causing time acceleration and expedition of the natural SAC cycle. The accelerated    
  schedule of Amenti Opening and Ascension Cycle events is as follows.

                        Events Leading to GA Crisis Intervention and Expedited Amenti Opening
     2.   2000 Jan 1 : Florida Shields Clinics,  Transcendence Day successful, Stellar Bridge
 Grounds on a 12-Code-Pulse for first time since 208,216 BC failed  SAC. 1998-2000 
 Anunnaki fully negate 1992 Emerald Covenant Pleiadian-Sirian Agreements and 
 revert to their original 9560 BC Atlantian Conspiracy/Luciferian Covenant OWO 
 Halls of Amenti Quest dominion/invasion agenda. 
         3.   2000 March:  Egypt Shields Clinic , GA/Indigos release D-8 Seal of Orion Templar
   Security Seal at Giza, Egypt. Emerald Covenant Founders and GA continue negotia-
   tions with Anunnaki in hope of reactivating Pleiadian-Sirian Agreements peace trea-
   ties so Final Con ﬂict War drama can be prevented during the SAC.
         4.   2000 May 5:  Florida Shields Clinic , Solar Spiral Alignment successful, Earth enters
  Solar Activation, Planetary Templar begins 12-Code-Pulse “Christos Activation” via 
  anchoring the “D-12 Hydroplasmic Beam” Solar Star Gate-4  (SG-4) link, “Templar 
  Re-Birthday Party”. 12-Code-Pulse activation makes D-12 Pre-matter “Divine Blue-
  print” Maharata Current frequency available on Earth for first  time since 208,216 BC 
  SAC “Fall of Brenaui” Invasion. Availability of D-12 Maharata Current  allows 
  potential to clear Earth’s Planetary Shields of NDC-Grid /Nibiru/Wormwood
  ''Checkerboard Matrix '' Templar distortions and to clear corresponding '' Checker-
  board Mutation ” from Earth-life DNA Template. Allows provides opportunity to 
  place Earth under full D-12 Planetary Maharic Seal protection and to fulfill Christos                                                                                                           
      Realignment Mission during this SAC to prevent Anunnaki, Drakonian and
  Andromie OWO invasion plans. 
         5.   2000 July 5:  Anunnaki reluctantly reenter Emerald Covenant Founders/GA Treaty 
  of Altair  Pleiadian-Sirian Agreements extension, fearing Drakonian advancement
  and potential failure of their OWO agenda due to GA Templar successes. Anunnaki 
  again agree to assist Founders in Christos Realignment Mission, disengage the
  ''Checkerboard Matrix'' Templar Control/DNA Mutation program, to turn Solar SG-
  4 and Alcyone SG-5, NDC-Grid and Primary 24 NCT-Bases  over to Emerald Cov-
  enant/GA protection to prevent SAC pole shift. 
       6.   2000 Aug: Macchu Picchu , Peru , Shields Clinic , Anunnaki reluctantly begin 
  agreed-upon Solar SG-4 transfer to Eieyani-GA as per Treaty of Altair. Emerald Cov-
  enant Eieyani High Council of Inner Earth make contact with Indigo Team in Peru to
  begin Masters Templar Training. GA clear NDC-Grid D3/D4 blockage in Earth-to-
  Sun/Earth-to-Mars/Earth-to-Tara  “Emerald Caverns ” SG-4 passages and Blue, Gold 
  and Violet Primal Light Pillars activated in SG-5 Machu Picchu, Peru.  
        7.    2000 Sep 12:  Stonehenge , England , Shields Clinic , Anunnaki to disengage  
           “Wormwood Battlestar”/ NDC-Grid Stonehenge link and turn NDC-Grid over to
     Emerald Covenant 12-Code-Pulse protection, as per Treaty of Altair. Anunnaki
     instead defect from Treaty of Altair  via Necromiton-Andromie persuasion, to join 
     UIR OWO War Edict  against Founders and Emerald Covenant nations with Necro-
     miton-Andromies/Drakonians. Anunnaki sabotage promised NDC-Grid GA transfer
     at Stonehenge England and assisted Drakonians and Necromiton-Andromies to use 
     NDC-Grid and Nibiruian controlled Ley Lines to launch Psycho-tronic attack on
     Indigo Templar Security Team in Manchester England. UIR attempt to '' blackmail '' 
     Founders  via Ultimatum  that 50,000 Eieyani High Council IndigoType-1 (out of
     550,000 Types-1, 2 and 3 presently on planet) could be freed and evacuated from Earth
     by UIR Galactic Federation, leaving all of Humanity and remaining Indigos to UIR
       takeover and 2008 pole shift demise. If Emerald Covenant Founders refused UIR              
          Ultimatum, UIR would issue immediate Edict of War against Founders and Emerald Cov-                                       
            enant/Human nations. Emerald Covenant nations collectively refuse UIR 
    blackmail Ultimatum intimidation ; UIR issue ''fight to the death'' Official Edict of 
    War.  
         8.     2000 Sept-2001April:  GA issues War Crisis Order , begin expedited revelation of 
    Atlantian Conspiracy Invasion Agenda,  institute early Masters Templar Planetary 
    Stewardship Initiative RRT plan,  and return full “Christos Realignment Mission”

(originally due 2012 May 5),  UIR expedites OWO agenda  to prevent Mass DNA     
12-Code from reaching critical mass in Earth’s grids; would naturally prevent UIR      
intended 2003 Dimensional Blend Experiment by amplifying 12-Code in Planetary      
Templar. UIR sends two “ ULF Slow Pulse”  sonic transmissions from Chihuahua,           
Mexico  and Lake Titicaca Peru NCT-Bases to fully activate Montauk-Phi-Ex               
APIN and connect Anunnaki APINs to Falcon Wormhole.

     Blue Wave Infusion  of D5/D6 frequency activates in Earth’s Core (originally due      
     2002 June), will reach critical mass to Activate in grids mid Nov-early Dec 2001 .                       
     NCT-Bases Sarasota, FL,  and Bermuda  partially realigned to 12-Code; UIR Psycho-

                         14.  2001 Sept 11:  UIR staged WTC/Pentagon Disaster Trigger Event  begins UIR/Ill-     
                    uminati WW3 agenda. UIR “Trumpet” Phantom Pulse amplified by Chihuahua/Titi-     
                              caca ULF Slow Pulse sent from Bermuda NCT-Base to WTC/Pentagon APIN “Spike”     
                    sites; Anunnaki Dove/Phoenix/Serpent APINs phase-1  “on line” with Zeta/ Drako-     
                    nian Falcon Wormhole. UIR/Illuminati Terrorist Event used to cloak potential Trum-     
                   pet Pulse damage to APIN “Spike” site buildings. UIR expedited Frequency Fence     
        and Psycho-tronic Pulse Program begins in Earth’s grids on Sept 12, 2001 , commem-     
                   orating the first anniversary  of the Sept 12, 2000 UIR declared War Edict.  Expedited     
                   UIR Frequency Fence, now progressively accelerating, is slowing 12-Code Mass DNA    
                   Template activation. If UIR 2003 Dimensional Blend Experiment did not have      
                   chance to succeed, UIR would give up their Halls of Amenti dominion Master Plan     
        and settle for Earth dominion/Human extinction until next potential SAC. In this      
                   case, UIR would stage direct, physical, Mothersship Invasion  as early as end of
                    2001 . To prevent early physical UIR invasion, GA will carefully modulate Planetary     
        Shields frequencies, creating progressive planetary protection while allowing the     
        potentiality for UIR Dimensional Blend Experiment success  until the GA/UIR     
        Show Down  of Aug 2003.

other undisclosed locations), GA initiates full Level-12 “4 Faces of Man” LPIN 
activation to link the "4 Faces" LPINs of Earth, Parallel Earth and Inner Earth 
("Guardians of the 12 Pillars") to Trans-Harmonic Meajhé Time Cycle via Primal
 Light-Sound Field " Rainbow Ray " Pillars . GA will use 12-Code realigned NDC-
Grid  and 24 NCT-Bases  to amplify D-12 frequency in Earth’s grids; Earth’s Planetary 
Shields draw into phase-lock with the Inner Earth Bridge Zone time cycle . The 
Trion/Meajhé Field “Buffer Blanket” in Earth’s magnetosphere and core will draw
Earth’s particle base into D-3 Nethra Phase Merkaba Vehicle  hyper-dimensional sus-
pension to create a protection field for biological Earth life. Earth enters  Level-3 Tem-
porary D-12 Planetary Maharic Seal  (dimensions 1z-3 of Earth Sealed to D-12 sub-
frequency bands) sustained by 12-Code activation of Inner Earth Crystal Pylon
Temples/Earth Cue Sites #1, #2 and #3 , fortifying the temporary Level-3 D-12 Cap  
on the Falcon-Phoenix Wormhole. Earth’s SGs and Ley Lines #1, #2 and #3 will 
be protected under D-12 Seal. Intended UIR 2003 end ''First Contact '' invasion drama  
prevented  as UIR Mother Ships will be blocked from entering D-3 airspace by Level-

Consummation/Activation November 2003.  
        GA/UIR “Show Down”  for Planetary Templar frequency control Aug 8-20,
2003.  UIR will attempt to "un-Cap" the Falcon-Phoenix Wormholes to orchestrate 
their Dimensional Blend "Experiment " in attempt to draw Earth’s Planetary Shields
into phase-lock with Phantom Matrix; UIR attempt to use all available “Trumpet”
pulse and APIN facilities to prevent success of GA Planetary Protection Plan and 
Freedom Agenda. GA will use Trion/Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket and Inner Earth 
Crystal Pylon Temples/Cue sites to keep grids stable to avoid cataclysm. The Mag-
netic Peak Climax  of Aug 12 will amplify the dominant frequencies in Earth’s grids, 
causing Earth’s Planetary Shields to phase-lock with either the Inner Earth Bridge 
Zone time cycle  or the Phantom Matrix time cycle . If UIR Dimensional Blend
 Experiment succeeds, GA will shift to Plan B Evacuations and UIR will advance 
intended Nov-Dec 2003 “First Contact” invasion drama Phase-1 , mass sighting dem-
onstration and selective Illuminati and Exterior Government administrative con-
tact. UIR forces stationed off planet in our Time Matrix will attempt to use their 
remaining scalar pulse technologies to erode Level-3 Planetary Maharic Seal before it
reaches full critical mass in Earth’s grids and is amplified to a Level-6 Maharic Seal by
GA target date of 2006 . UIR will motivate Illuminati races to use earthly scalar pulse 
and nuclear technologies to further compromise Level-3 Planetary Maharic Seal and 
Trion/Meajhe Field “Buffer Blanket” integrity and to assist UIR in removing Level-3 
D-12 Cap on Falcon-Phoenix Wormholes to reinstate open D-3 Phantom Matrix 
access. UIR "First Contact" invasion date will be expedited to Nov-Dec 2003
 in order to bring cloaked Beam Ships to Earth to take over GA APINs and to sever Plan-
etary Trion/Meajhé Field ''Buffer Blanket" link. The group having critical mass fre-
quency control of Earth’s Templar on Aug 12, 2003  will retain governing control

to disengage GA LPIN/APINs and to erode Temporary Level-3 Maharic Seal. If all 
goes well, the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period can be held off until June, poss-
ibly Dec 2006 , giving time for intensive GA RRT  efforts to strengthen the Trion/       
Meajhe Field Buffer Blanket. 
        A greater quantity of Earth’s Planetary Shields, geographical territories and      
populations will progress into Trion/Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket protection if the      
Three-Day Particle Conversion Period can be postponed for as long as possible. 
Emerald Covenant Founders and GA can slow Earth’s accelerated frequency acc-
retion progression to hold off the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period only until     
2006. This can be achieved  only if humanity is willing to assist in Emerald Cove-      
nant RRTs through which the integrity of the Temporary Level-3/Level-6 Plane-      
tary Maharic Seal and Buffer Blanket can be maintained.   With success of the GA      
2003 Temporary Level-3 Planetary Maharic Seal, UIR in this Time Matrix, unable to      
secure ample Phantom Matrix reinforcements due to the Wormhole Cap, will likely      
continue their Templar Conquest efforts via manipulation of Illuminati  forces. Tem-      
porary Level-3 Planetary Maharic Seal will continue to prevent the UIR 2003 “First      
Contact” invasion drama. UIR will likely revert to their original 2005 First Contact      
invasion schedule , or motivate their Illuminati forces to create a  hoax “Fake Land-      
ing”,  if they deem such an event useful to their continuing invasion strategy. After       
2003, UIR efforts will focus upon eroding Earth’s Temporary Level-3/Level-6 Plane-      
tary Maharic Seal and un-Capping the Wormholes to initiate their “First Contact”       
drama by  2005 , for orchestrated pole shift and final invasion between 2008-2011.       
UIR is also expected to intensify their efforts of waging a vicious “ideological war”       
against Emerald Covenant nations via further manipulation of Illuminati and of peo-      
ples within the UFO and New Age Movements and traditional religious dogmas. 
        If UIR compromises the Temporary Level-3/ Level-6 Planetary Maharic Seal 
any time between 2003-2006 , GA will be forced to allow Earth’s core time rhythm
to accelerate on its natural cycle. This will initiate rapid entry into the Three-Day 
Particle Conversion Period  and full Permanent Level-12 Planetary Maharic Seal  
(dimensions 1 through 12 Sealed to D-12 sub-frequency bands) before the Trion/
Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket accretes to global coverage . Areas of Earth not under suf-
ficient Trion/Meajhé Field protection will be unable to hold Permanent Level-12 
Maharic Seal; the intensive frequency infusions characteristic to the Three-Day Part-
icle Conversion Period will cause Earth Changes in unprotected areas. In this event, 
GA will initiate rapid acceleration of D-3 Nethra Phase Merkaba/Level-3 Temporary
Planetary Maharic Seal Safe Zones to D-9 Quatra Phase Merkaba/ Level-9 Temporary 
Planetary Maharic Seal protection. Portions of Earth’s Planetary Shields under Quatra
Phase Merkaba protection will then be shifted into merger with the Trans-Harmonic
Meajhé Zone Time Cycle . The neighboring Time Matrix of the Trans-harmonic 
Meajhé Zone Time Cycle will serve as a frequency buffer and “electromagnetic 
anchoring field” through which Safe Zone areas of the planet can be “hosted” into the 
Inner Earth Bridge Zone Time Continuum by 2012 .

          This is not the most desired scenario , but rather the final "Emergency Contin-
 gency Plan " that will be employed if events in this SAC proceed in a manner any 
 worse than they already have . If unfolding events dictate the necessity of invoking
 the Emergency Contingency Plan, GA will mobilize their earthly Indigo Children 
 Planetary Security Teams to offer regional Meajhé Zone  Evacuation  options, to get as      
 many people as possible into Quatra Phase Merkaba/Meajhé "Safe Zones." If the 
Three-Day Particle Conversion Period is triggered into activation before 2006, the        
Temporary Cap on the Falcon-Phoenix Wormholes will be partially compromised;  
areas with insufficient Trion/Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket protection will be left to       
progressive UIR infiltration and transfer into the Phantom Matrix Sub-T ime Distor-
tion Cycle. If a sufficient number of GA RRTs are conducted to maintain Trion/
Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket integrity, UIR forces will be unable to un-Cap the 
Wormholes, bring in “Mother Ships” for the “First Contact” drama or compromise the      
Temporary Level-3/Level-6 Planetary Maharic Seal in Merkaba “Safe Zone” areas. 
 32.   2003 Dec-2006 June:  GA continues to strengthen Trion/Meajhe Field Buffer Blan-      
        ket. Between Dec 2003-June 2006, Earth enters Level-6 Temporary Planetary Maha-      
        ric Seal  (dimensions 1-2-3-4-5-6 of Earth Sealed to D-12 sub-frequency bands)       
     sustained by 12-Code activation of Inner Earth Crystal Pylon Temples/Earth Cue      
     Sites #1, #2, #3, #4, #5 and #6 . Earth’s SGs and Ley Lines  #1, #2, #3, #4, #5 and       
        #6  will be protected under D-12 Maharic Seal. Temporary Level-6 Planetary Maharic       
     Seal will progressively move Earth and Tara into temporary hyper-dimensional sus-      
        pension of D-6 Planetary Hallah Phase Merkaba Vehicle , creating a temporary                   
        Level-6 D-12 Cap on the Falcon-Phoenix Wormhole. In June 2006, GA will acceler-      
     ate Level-6 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal/D-6 Planetary Hallah Phase Merkaba      
     to Level-9 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal/D-9 Planetary Quatra Phase Merkaba.      
     Regions of Earth capable of progressing into 2006 Quatra Phase Merkaba will be       
     fully protected from the physics realities of the 2006 Three-Day Particle Conver-      
     sion Period . If Three-Day Particle Conversion Period occurs before 2006, or if regions      
     cannot hold a Level-9 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal by 2006, only areas with       
        critical mass Trion/Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket will retain Hallah Phase Merkaba/       
        Level-6 Maharic Seal sufficient to accelerate to Level-9 Temporary Planetary Maharic      
     Seal/ D-9 Planetary Quatra Phase Merkaba. Areas holding D-9 Planetary Quatra       
        Phase Merkaba will fully enter Trion/ Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket protection for       
        Three-Day Particle Conversion Period.
 33.  2006 June : Expedited Three-Day Particle Conversion Period and the 4.25 Trion      
     Buffer Bubble . Sometime between June and Dec 2006, Earth will encounter the       
        Three-Day Particle Conversion Period  (See page 223); fulfillment of the " Night of      
        the Two Moons"  prophecy. Earth will come into full alignment with the Holographic      
     Beam/Photon Belt ( originally due 2017, May 5-June 30 ), while protected within       
        the Trion/Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket. If the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period      
        is successfully postponed until 2006, GA will continue strengthening the Trion/       
        Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket in attempt to pull all of Earth  into D-9 Planetary Qua-      
     tra Phase/Merkaba Vehicle  hyper-dimensional suspension. In June 2006, Earth enters      
      Level-9 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal  (dimensions 1-9 of Earth Sealed to D-12      
     sub-frequency bands) sustained by 12-Code activation of Inner Earth Crystal Pylon      
        Temples/Earth Cue Sites #1 through #9. Earth’s SGs  and Ley Lines  #1 through #9      
     will be protected under D-12 Maharic Seal, creating a temporary Level-9 D-12 Cap      
     on the Falcon-Phoenix Wormhole.  The Trion/Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket will       
     absorb and collect the frequencies that will release through the final three Stellar                 
        Activations/Stellar Wave Infusions , holding these frequencies in suspension until       
        2012 , when they will be released into Earth’s Planetary Shields in completion of the      
        Arcturian, Orion and Andromeda Activations. As the Three-Day Particle Conver-       
        sion Period approaches, the GA will create a temporary 4.25-dimensional  magnetic      
        field  within the Trion/Meajhe Field Buffer Blanket. The natural Planetary Shields of      
        Earth’s counterpart planet in the neighboring Trans-harmonic Meajhé Time Matrix

                           Expedited Amenti Opening Crisis Intervention Program Begins
(not the planetary counterparts in THIS or the Inner Earth Time Matrix) will be used        
to accrete and sustain this 4.25-dimensional magnetic field in the Trion/Meahjé Field       
Buffer Blanket. 
        For the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period, during which time Earth’s natu-        
 ral magnetic fields normally collapse, the portions of Earth’s Planetary Shields and        
corresponding geographical regions in Safe Zones will be drawn into full vibrational         
co-resonance with the 4.25-dimensional magnetic fields sustained  in the Buffer Blan-        
 ket. This will allow regions of Earth, and populations, that are able to achieve tempo-        
 rary Quatra Phase Merkaba , to enter the Safe Zone of the 4.25 magnetic field region       
of the Buffer Blanket. The 4.25 magnetic field will create a stable D-4.25 “Energy        
Bubble”  within which the 3-dimensional particle base of Earth and its inhabitants             
 will be protected from the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period frequencies that set         
atomic transmutation in motion. Though the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period       
will commence in 2006, its manifest effects  will be temporarily delayed until 2012  due              
to the “4.25 Trion Buffer Bubble”.  In the original Amenti Ascension schedule, the         
Three-Day Particle Conversion Period was due to take place in 2017, at which time         
regions of Earth that could sustain 4.5 accretion  level would fully transfer into the        
 Inner Earth Bridge Zone Time Continuum. Areas and populations that could not sus-        
 tain 4.5 accretion  (all of 4th DNA Strand and one-half of 5th Strand activation)         
would separate and be drawn into the Phantom Earth/Phantom Matrix Sub-time Dis-         
tortion Cycle. Elements of the “manifest hologram” that “fell to Phantom Earth”             
would literally appear to have “disappeared” from the face of the Earth , to the per-      
ceptions of populations successfully achieving the Bridge Zone Time Cycle Shift. Pres-       
 ently, though posing more inherent risk of failure , the Emergency Crisis        
 Intervention program of the Trion/Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket provides for greater        
opportunities of population protection  not originally possible within the dynamics of        
physics of the Bridge Zone Project. 
         The “4.25 Trion Buffer Bubble” and the Trion/Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket sur-        
rounding it, will allow Earth to pass through the Three-Day Particle Conversion         
Period, through which progressive bi-polarization and separation of the global particle         
field and populations into the Bridge Zone and Phantom Matrix Time Continua will        
 occur.  By the end of 2006  this separation of Time Lines within Earth’s Planetary         
Shields will be permanent . However, the Trion/Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket will oper-          
ate as a " carrier wave field " that will temporarily hold the bi-polarized particle base of       
Earth’s Planetary Shields, time lines and populations together, in a state of slow-mov-       
ing particle suspension  during and for a time after, the Three-Day Particle Conver-       
sion Period. This process of SAC physics is distinctly different from the complete,        
 rapid separation of particle base, time lines and populations  that would have         
occurred during the later 2017 Three-Day Particle Conversion Period. All of Earth’s        
particle base and populations can be protected from falling into Phantom Matrix         
merger, if full Planetary Quatra Phase Merkaba  can be achieved in 2006 .  Popula-         
tions would no longer separate into the Phantom Earth and Bridge Zone Time Con-         
tinua as originally anticipated; all would  "make it to the Bridge Zone " continuum         
out of harms way . This ideal scenario is not likely to occur  due to the continuing         
counter-activities of the UIR; GA will none-the-less strive to achieve this ideal . If         
full Planetary Quatra Phase Merkaba can be achieved in 2006, the UIR invasion plans        
would be brought to a screeching halt as they would have insufficient time, before        
 2011, to compromise a 12-Code seal on nine dimensional levels of Earth-Tara-Gaia         
and their corresponding Time Continua.
       Unfortunately, the GA have insufficient time before 2006, to strengthen the              
Planetary Trion/Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket on a global level and to completely clear       
distortions in Earth’s grids to the degree required, to initiate full D-9 Planetary Quatra        
Phase Merkaba in 2006. Forcing a D-9 Quatra Merkaba on the entire planet in 2006,        
before Planetary Shields distortions were fully aligned with the D-12 Planetary Divine       
Blueprint, would cause pole shift and cataclysm for all.  GA will attempt to prepare         
the entire planet for 2006 D-9 Quatra Merkaba Conversion, but full success in         
this objective is not likely to occur.  Areas of Earth that do not have sufficient critical

mass of Trion/Meajhe Field frequency will be unable to hold a Level-9 Temporary       
Planetary Maharic Seal/ D-9 Quatra Merkaba. Such areas will endure progressive      
escalation of UIR/Illuminati OWO advancement, storms, famine, loss of life, quake      
and volcanic activity and political warring, and progressive deterioration of the Level-      
6 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal. 
       “Safe Zone”  areas under sufficient Trion/Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket and Tem-      
porary Level-9 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal protection will remain more stable,     
environmentally, politically and economically.  Conditions in unsafe zones will pro-      
gressively deteriorate as the UIR attempts to un-Cap the Falcon-Phoenix Wormholes,      
while advancing their invasion agenda in unprotected regions toward the 2011 Final      
Conﬂict. The 2006 Three-Day Particle Conversion Period will be the determining      
factor in what portions of Earth’s geography will undergo final cataclysmic shift      
into the Phantom Matrix in 2012 . Regions co-resonant with the Phantom Matrix       
time line will undergo some degree of geophysical changes , such as severe quaking or     
submergence beneath the waters, between 2006-2017 . But the populations  in these      
regions will still have some time left to develop biological co-resonance with Safe       
Zones, after Particle Conversion occurs. The 4.25 Trion Buffer Bubble will create sta-      
ble areas of land mass and culture that are held secure within D-9 Quatra Phase Merk-      
aba Field protection, and which will sustain a constant D-4.25  magnetic field.  The D-      
4.25 magnetic field will allow any life forms with 4.25 DNA Strand Template activa-      
tion²   to move into Safe Zone territories for final 2012  transition into the Inner Earth      
Bridge Zone Time Continuum.  Originally a 4.5 DNA Strand Template activation       
level was needed for passage into the Bridge Zone continuum. 
        Now, populations with a lower 4.25-DNA Strand Template activation  will       
have greater opportunity to “make it to the Bridge Zone” in 2012. The general Trion/      
Meajhe Field Buffer Blanket in Earth’s magnetosphere will provide non-Safe Zone      
regions with some degree of protection  during the 3-Day Particle Conversion       
period, preventing full planetary magnetic field collapse. These areas will be less stable      
and more prone to anomalous geological, climatic, atmospheric and electromagnetic      
phenomena than Safe Zone areas under the 4.25 Trion Buffer Bubble protection. Fol-      
lowing the 2006 Three-Day Particle Conversion Period, and until 2012 , regions and      
populations co-resonant with the Phantom Matrix time line will have greater protec-      
tion from succumbing to immediate Phantom Matrix descent. These regions of Earth      
will experience a " slow fall " to the Phantom Matrix, with less severe Earth Changes,      
spread out over a longer period of time, than would have occurred with the “fast fall”      
2017 Particle Conversion Period. The ''slow fall" allows for the potential of retrieving      
greater population numbers from Phantom Matrix demise. The 4.25 Trion Buffer Bub-      
ble plan was not originally considered viable,  as it required that Earth’s grid speed be      
rapidly accelerated by 2006 to a minimum of D-9 oscillation/ Planetary Quatra Phase      
Merkaba/ Level-9 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal. This rapid grid speed accelera-      
tion increases the potentialities of greater Earth Changes and possibilities of pole      
shift  before 2012 arrives, which is a risk to all populations that Emerald Covenant       
nations were not originally willing to take.    
      As circumstances have evolved, the Anunnaki races  defecting from the 2000      
Treaty of Altair and 1992 Pleiadian-Sirian Agreements have made the decision for      
everyone . Due to their support of the UIR OWO dominion campaign, pole shift       
and destruction of the Human race  by 2008 would be a certainty, if the Trion/Meajhé      
Field Buffer Blanket and 4.25 Trion Buffer Bubble option was not immediately called      
into play. The Trion/Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket/4.25 Buffer Bubble plan will create a      
condition of progressively extreme bi-polarity  among global Human nations and Illu-      
minati collectives. “Very Safe” GA Safe Zone areas will be interspersed among “very      
unsafe” UIR dominated areas. Extreme differences in polarity between DNA Tem-       
plate activation levels, and thus maturity and stability of consciousness and fortitude      
of biological constitution among world populations, along with resultant confronta-

                        It will seem as if the world has “divided itself into “good vs. evil”, with little space      
                        between the two opposing consciousness factions; sadly, each “side” of the polarity      
                        drama will perceive themselves as the “victims” and “good guys”, viewing the “other      
                        side” as the “evil, victimizing enemy”. During these coming difficult times, GA  will      
                        promote the necessity of Healing through recognition of our Common Divine Source.      
                        They will also teach of the Law of One Christos realities of the D-12 Pre-matter      
                        Divine Blueprint, through which all polarities and separations can be mended, and by      
                        which beings of every species, race and creed can tangibly integrate the One-Spirit

 which is referred to as the Meajhé Field,  until 2012 . Until 2012, the Meajhé Field         
 will be sustained by Level-9 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal/D-9 Quatra Phase

 take place.  Meajhé Field Safe Zones, or “ Meajhé Zones ” will provide a natural fre-      
 quency buffer to the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period frequency infusions and          
 will be the most environmentally and culturally stable areas of the globe during the            
 remainder of the SAC. Meajhé Zones will also provide environmental support to the

 Portions of Earth and its populations co-resonant to the Phantom Matrix Sub-time

          The Planetary Trion Field will provide temporary protection from the 2006       
       Three-Day Particle Conversion Period, and will to some degree buffer the transmuta-      
    tive frequencies characteristic to this event; it will protect these areas from Phantom            
       Matrix descent until 2012. Ideally, the Planetary Trion Field will be sustained by       
       Level-6 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal/D-6 Hallah Phase Merkaba Vehicle       
       until 2012, when final transition into the Phantom Matrix time continuum will take      
       place via apparent regional Earth Changes.  Areas of Earth under Trion Field Hallah      
       Phase Merkaba protect are called “Trion Zones”. Earth’s SGs and portals in Trion             
       Zones, protected by the Trion Field Hallah Phase Merkaba, will have only a 6-dimen-      
       sional protective seal . Despite GA efforts to retain this protection, UIR forces may             
       compromise this Level-6 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal to partially un-Cap the          
       Wormholes as early as 2005, which will intensify Earth Changes potentials in these               
       regions in 2005 and during the 2006 Three-Day Particle Conversion Period. Follow-                
       ing Earth’s 2006 passage through the Three-Day Particle Conversion Period, areas              
        under Quatra Phase Merkaba/Meajhé Zone protection cannot be intrinsically com-            
       promised by UIR activities. Meajhe Zones may suffer a small degree of temporary               
       instability if UIR infiltration of Trion Zones is extensive, but Meajhé Zones will re-              
       stabilize to complete the Bridge Zone time continuum shift in 2012.
           If UIR is successful in eroding the Level-6 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal in            
    Trion Field areas, they will move forth with their intended Illuminati OWO agenda,      
    Frequency Fence and "First Contact" drama. In this case, populations within Meajhé      
    Zones  will be most protected from the effects of OWO progression. Beginning in            
    2002-2003, GA will provide the Indigo Planetary Security Team with information for

graphical development of Meajhé and Trion Zone areas. The regional Quatra Phase
Merkaba Vehicles surrounding "Meajhé Safe Zones" will operate like '' invisible envi-
ronmental force-fields ." Populations can come and go through these areas unabated. 
With a bit of a practice, individuals with DNA Strand Template-4 12-Code activation 
or higher will be able to sense the electro-static boundaries  of Meajhé Zones. Those    
with lesser strand level, or less than 12-Code3), DNA Template activation will be 
unable to detect Meajhé Zone perimeters. Under most conditions, conventional sci-
entific instruments are not sensitive enough to multi-spectrum electromagnetic sub-
tleties to detect Meajhe Zones. The Quatra Phase Merkaba Vehicles of Meajhé Zone
regions will hold the natural "Divine Blueprint '' integrity of nine out of 12 dimen-
sional levels of the land, atmosphere and magnetic fields in these regions, creating
enhanced biological protection from UIR Frequency Fence, RIT, Psycho-tronic and 
Bio-warfare technologies. 
       The Planetary Shields in Meajhé Zone areas will hold higher frequency and
have a faster particle pulsation rhythm, which will make these areas seem " almost 
invisible " to Illuminati and UIR attentions. People with 12-Code activating DNA4 
will be instinctually drawn to Meajhé Zone areas via vibrational co-resonance  of the
biological/mental/emotional/spiritual bodies. Individuals carrying excessive DNA     
Template and consciousness distortions, such as Illuminati and Fallen Angelic races, 
or people carrying Fallen Angelic astral Tagging or possession, will experience varying 
degrees of biological disharmony and mental/emotional fatigue or agitation in     
response to Meajhé Zone frequencies.5
       Meajhé Zone and Trion Zone regions and the populations within them will 
exist “side by side”, each experiencing a different set of events and frequencies,
until their final separation in 2012 . GA general education programs will continue to
focus upon assisting people to regenerate the DNA Template, Bio-energetic Field and 
Spiritual Consciousness integrity that is needed to sustain the body within Meajhé
Zone areas. Meajhé Zone Indigo education programs will focus upon Crisis Interven-
tion “Trouble Shooting”, the advanced Planetary Templar Mechanics needed to sus-
tain the integrity of the Meajhé/Trion Field Buffer Blanket, coping skills for 
accelerated DNA Template activation, outreach programs to assist those in Trion 
Zones and preparation for physical GA contact. After the 2006 Three-Day Particle
Conversion Period, the GA, via the Indigo Team, will "put out the last call" for Emer-
ald Covenant Amnesty and Redemption Contracts . All Illuminati races  and 
Humans desiring to become free of Fallen Angelic manipulation and Phantom Matrix 
descent will have a final opportunity to "make it to the Bridge Zone." These efforts 
will continue until  2011 , when the last round of the "Final Con ﬂict" drama is due to 
unfold.

                                 Expedited Amenti Opening Crisis Intervention Program Begins
  after Earth’s successful passage into, and stabilization within, the Bridge Zone time 
   cycle. On Earth, the UIR is likely to succeed in at least partially fulfilling its  2005 
  First Contact '' invasion  attempt within the Trion Zones.  If the GA is successful in 
  creating the 2003 Level-3 Temporary Planetary Maharic Seal, the 2003 UIR invasion 
  schedule will be effectively postponed, but not permanently prevented. In 2005 , it is
  unlikely that UIR will be able to utilize their massive Mother -ship ﬂeet, due to the 
  Cap on the Falcon-Phoenix Wormholes. The use of smaller craft and a less dramatic
  public debut are the more likely UIR strategies. (If UIR erodes the Level-3 D-12 Cap 
  on the Wormholes, the UIR "Mother ship" agenda may unfold in 2005 as they had 
  originally planned.) The GA’s successful activation of the "4 Faces of Man"/"Guard-
  ians of the 12 Pillars" LPIN and "Great White Lion" and "Golden Eagle" APINs will 
  thwart the UIR “real estate clearing through 2008 pole shift” agenda. The GA LPIN/
  APIN systems, coupled with the Trion/Meajhé Field Planetary Buffer Blanket, will 
  hold the core of Earth’s Planetary Shields stable throughout the SAC until 2011, 
  when the only remaining “ window of opportunity ” to create planetary pole shift             
         arises.   
    
    Whether the UIR has succeeded or not in progressing to on-planet physical pre-
sence, they will launch their last invasion attempt in 2011.  This will be their last chance
to prevent the Emerald Covenant nations from permanently  severing the links between 
our living Time Matrix and the Phantom Matrix  via fulfillment of the Emerald Cove-
nant Founders’ Christos Realignment Mission.   It will be the UIR’s last opportunity ever
to gain access to the Halls of Amenti Star Gates and Inner Earth Time Cycle territories.  
   If the GA is successful in 2012, the scalar-field templates of our Universal Time 
Matrix and those of the Phantom Matrix will be permanently severed , effectively closing
all Wormhole links to the Phantom Matrix in our 15-Dimensional Time Matrix. Our 
Time Matrix will be prevented from being consumed by the Black Hole Sub-time Distor-
tion system Phantom Matrix anomaly and finally, after literally 250 billion years of 
intergalactic warring,  Phantom Matrix races will no longer be able to enter our Time 
Matrix for feeding and invasion.  Phantom Matrix races remaining in our Time Matrix 
will require DNA Template 12-Code Bio-regenesis  to biologically survive in this system,
and their advanced weapons systems and technologies will no longer function without 
access to the reversed-polarity  electromagnetic currents  of Phantom Matrix.  
                 If the UIR’s intended 2011 final invasion attempt fails, as it is likely to do  if the GA
Crisis Intervention Plan succeeds to this point, Fallen Angelic races will have one final 
opportunity to enter Emerald Covenant Redemption Contracts for DNA Bio-Regenesis 
under galactic quarantine in the Sirius star system . If they refuse this opportunity, their 
only remaining options will be to return to Phantom Matrix before it is closed, or to 
live out a finite destiny of rapid biological and technological deterioration, within galax-
ies of this Time Matrix that have not yet been placed under full Level-12 Maharic Seal. If 
the Planetary Christos Realignment Mission, which was originally scheduled for comple-
tion during the 22,326 BC SAC , is not completed during this SAC, the Halls of Amenti 
will progressively fall to Phantom Matrix particle fusion.   
             The Phantom Matrix is an unnatural Black Hole system  that continually accretes 
 energy and consciousness  from the living “host” Time Matrix to which it is attached.  In          
           22,326BC, the Founders recognized that the Phantom Matrix, created during the Lyran-    
              Elohim Founders Wars 250 billion years ago,6 had almost reached critical mass accretion. 
The Black Hole system had pulled into itself nearly as much energy mass and conscious-
ness than that organically held within our natural living Time Matrix. If the Phantom 
Matrix reaches critical mass accretion , its draw upon the living Time Matrix will progres-
                             sively accelerate and our living Time Matrix will be permanently “pulled off  the grids” of                                 
                  the Density-5 Primal Light Fields and into the chaotically organized, finite Phantom 
                              Matrix. If the Christos Realignment Mission  is not successful during the current SAC,    
                     this entire Time Matrix, not only the Earth, will be pulled into the Phantom Matrix  
                             Black Hole via the Halls of Amenti Star Gates. Many innocent inter-galactic civilizations

would be trapped in Phantom Time, denied their birth right of organic Ascension, Mas-      
tery and Eternal life. The Emerald Covenant Founders have allowed the Phantom Matrix      
to remain attached to our Time Matrix for over 250 billion years,  in hope of lovingly re-      
evolving the Fallen Angelic races r esiding there within. The Founders and the Fallen      
Angelics knew in 22,326BC that the “ time was up ” for giving the Fallen Angelic races      
further evolutionary opportunity; the " host" Time Matrix was due to collapse  due to the       
continuing competitive choices of exploitation repeatedly made by the Fallen Angelic      
races. No one is treating the Fallen Angelic races unfairly; since 22,326 BC they have      
been faced with the product of their own unloving, exploitative choices .              
       Since the issue of severing the ties between the Living and Phantom Matrices came                     
 to a head in 22,326 BC, the Fallen Angelics have planned to achieve forced dominion of      
this Time Matrix, with intention of drawing it into Phantom Matrix as an energetic “food           
supply”. They continue to make this unfortunate choice, rather than accepting the             
Founders continually loving invitation into peaceful Emerald Covenant Co-evolution           
Freedom Treaties. Through cooperation with the Founders races, the Fallen Angelic races     
could progressively heal to re-enter At-One-ment with the Cosmic design, through              
which the Phantom Matrix could be healed.  If the Anunnaki had been true to the 1992        
Pleiadian-Sirian Agreements, the time of  Fallen Angelic accountability would have      
been postponed until the 4230 time continuum end. Due to the Anunnaki, Drakonian      
and Necromiton-Andromie races continual and contemporary choices of War over peace,      
hatred over love and dominion over freedom, they have brought their own “Day of Judg-      
ement”  down upon themselves. The Emerald Covenant nations wish the Fallen Angelics’     
no harm, and are not judging them as “unworthy”, but neither can they further permit the     
self-serving Fallen Angelic nations to bring death, sorrow, pain and destruction to the      
peace-loving races of this Time Matrix. The Planetary Christos Realignment Mission  will        
be fulfilled in 2012 , as part of the Universal Christos Realignment Mission  now taking      
place in this Time Matrix. It is the time for the Fallen Angelics themselves to judge      
“which side of  the fence” they will end up on as the Christos R ealignment Mission is fulfilled .

                                                           AND TRUMPET PULSE    
        
     In 2011 the UIR will attempt to take advantage of a temporary weakness  in the 
Planetary Meajhé Zone Field. This Meajhé Zone weakness will naturally occur as Earth’s 
Planetary Shields transition from D-9 Quatra Phase Merkaba into D-12 Mahunta Phase
Merkaba  to make the final 2012 link with the Inner Earth Bridge Zone time continuum.
As Earth’s Planetary Shields are prepared to fulfill the 2012 shift in Angular Rotation of 
Particle Spin from the 4.25 Trion Buffer Blanket, the natural spin ratios of the planetary 
Quatra Phase Merkaba will temporarily slow. This temporary 3-4 month Quatra Phase 
Merkaba slowing  will cause the Level-9 Planetary Maharic Seal to temporarily dip to a
Level-7 (7-dimensional) Maharic Seal . During this period there is a remote chance that 
the UIR could utilize the " Seven Trumpets"  sub-space sonic pulse technology on D-7
Phantom Arcturus  to re-activate the Seven Jehovian Seal sites on Earth, to blast 
through the temporary Cap on the Wormholes before the Cap becomes permanent in 
2012.  
                        If  this endeavor were to be successful, and the Falcon-Phoenix Wormholes were to 
                 be reactivated as the Meajhé Zones of Earth were transitioning into the Bridge Zone con- 
                 tinuum, cataclysm would result. The Quatra Phase Merkaba needed for the Bridge Zone 
                 link would be slowed in speed, via “Trumpet” pulse, to that of a D-6 Hallah Phase Mer-
                    kaba Vehicle. Once Meajhé Fields were reduced to D-6 vibration, the “Trumpet Pulses” of 
                 D -7 Phantom Arcturus could be used to force Earth’s D-6 Hallah Phase Merkaba into the 
                 re verse-rotation characteristic to Phantom Matrix. The Trion/Meajhé Field Buffer Blan-
                 ket would prevent Meajhé areas of Earth from being pulled into Phantom Matrix, but 
                 would not sustain grid speed acceleration sufficient to make the Bridge Zone link. Cata-              
                 clysmic Earth changes would begin followed by pole shift by 2012 . If this diabolical UIR 
                 strategy   were    to     succeed,  little  of      Earth’ s     populations would   survive. GA    Maharajhi      fleets  
                  from Sirius B would descend through the Halls of Amorea passage in attempt to launch

evacuations and to protect the 12 Primary Cue Site entrances to the Inner Earth Halls of 
Amenti control temples. Intensive “Star Wars”  would break out in Earth’s skies and
regional galaxies, with earthly nations caught in the crossfire, as UIR and competing rebel 
Omicron-Drakonian ﬂeets from Phantom Matrix poured into Earth’s local galaxies.
Though Emerald Covenant ﬂeets would succeed in preventing UIR takeover of the Inner 
Earth Halls of Amenti control sites, the Planetary Christos Realignment Mission and 
Level-12 Planetary Maharic Seal could not be fulfilled due to further damage to Earth’s 
Planetary Shields. Human civilization on Earth would again be decimated, as it has been 
several times in the past, and major intergalactic wars would again break out as they did 
550 million, 30 million, 5.5 million and 4.5 million years ago. The 2011 period of weak-
ness in Earth’s Meajhé Zones is anticipated to begin between April-July 2011 , and will 
last for a 3 to 4 month  period, into August or latest Nov of  2011. UIR has their  final con-
quest invasion strategy underway, but so too do Emerald Covenant nations have their
counter-strategy in place.

                                         A collective of renegade Necromiton-Andromie/Jehovian Anunnaki hybrid
 Nephilim races , now members of the UIR, have been initiating progressive covert con-
tact with a group of Humans known as the Labyrinth Group ”. The Labyrinth Group is a 
covert collective of humans directly involved with the 1972-1973 archaeological discover-
ies known as the " Ancient Arrow Wingmakers Site " in New Mexico . Using their usual 
talents of truth-twisting, dispensation of partial knowledge and embellished disinforma-
tion, this Nephilim group, which is code named the “ Corteum ”, have deceived the Laby-
rinth Group into assisting them to create a  crystalline-scalar-mechanics based weapons
technology . In order for the UIR to take advantage of this final 2011 invasion opportu-
nity, they must re-activate the Seven Jehovian Seal sites on Earth in order to use the
"Seven Trumpets" technologies of D-7 Phantom Arcturus to upcap the Falcon-Phoenix 
Wormholes. The Seven Jehovian Seal sites will have been re-calibrated to a Level 9 12-
Code Pulse7 by 2011. The technology the Corteum has inspired the Labyrinth Group to 
create is intended to assist the UIR in re-activating the seven Jehovian Seals on a Phan-
tom Matrix electromagnetic pulse, to allow for fulfillment of the UIR’s OWO final vic-
tory.  
   The Corteum technology utilizes inter-time manipulations  intended to create
"minute time rips " into the Phantom Matrix in regions connecting to the Seven 
Jehovian Seal sites. Through these "minute time rips." which represent a type of worm-
hole bridge, the UIR intends to build up sufficient sub-space photo-sonic "charge" within
the Axiatonal Line system of Parallel Earth.  The photo-sonic charge is intended to be
progressively stored and amplified in the Parallel Earth Planetary Shields until  2008,  
at which time the charge is intended to be split into two " Phantom Electrostatic ionic 
pulses. " One pulse is to be sent back in time to the original 10,500 BC creation of the 
Falcon-Phoenix Wormholes, the other into " future time " in the Phantom Earth time 
cycle.  The "past" pulse will connect the 10,500 BC  Atlantian period  of Phantom Earth,  
in which the Luciferian Rebellion takeover attempt succeeded, to our present time con-
tinuum line. The "future" pulse will connect the "future" of Phantom Earth, which 
evolved from the successful Phantom Earth Luciferian Conquest “past”, to our present
time continuum. Through the mechanics of the Labyrinth Group’s Corteum technology,
which the group has code-named the " Blank Slate Technology " or " BST " (Founders
think of it as " the BeaST "), the UIR intends to accumulate photo-sonic charge in the 
Phantom Earth future location and the 10,500 BC Luciferian Conquest period of Phan-
tom Earth Atlantis. When the 2011  "window of opportunity" opens, the UIR intends to
use the contemporary "BeaST" to direct the amplified photo-sonic charge simultaneously 
into the Seven Jehovian Seal sites of Earth’s Planetary Shields, in the contemporary time,
past Atlantian and future Phantom Earth periods.

       Release of the “ BeaST Pulse ” is intended to accomplish several invasion objec-
 tives, the first of which is to re-activate the Seven Jehovian Seal sites in each time period. 
 The second objective of the BeaST Pulse is to tear Earth’s Shields apart via bonding 
 Earth’s grids to the compromised grids of Parallel Earth, which are presently linked to 
     Phantom Earth. Completion of the second objective, which would culminate in the       
      North American continent begin vertically ripped into two sub-continents along the               
       Mississippi River vertical,  is intended to set the stage for fulfillment of objective three .
 Objective three constitutes the intentional shattering of the dimension 8 through 12 por-
 tions of Earth’ s Planetary Shields and reversal of the natural “Fire Letter Sequences”8 
 in the D-1 through D-7 portions of Earth’s Planetary Shields. This despicable plan would 
 seemingly serve to " erase history ," creating a " Blank Slate " of Earth history within which 
   to inset the history of Phantom Earth (thus the “BS-T” code name). Once the BeaST         
    Pulse was used to link past and future Earth to Phantom Earth, the “ Seven Trumpets ”           
   sub-space sonic pulse technologies of Phantom Arcturus would then be used to un-Cap,
  then merge, the Falcon-Phoenix W ormholes in present time. Portions of Earth’ s Plane-
  tary Shields under Trion Zone  suspension would be torn away and drawn into merger 
  with Phantom Earth. Corresponding portions of our present time line would be drawn 
  into merger with a corresponding present point in the Phantom Earth time line, and 
  these  portions of our present time line would be "spliced " into a position between the 
  10,500 BC Atlantis and future Atlantis in Phantom Earth’s time line .  
       It would be as if our true history was “erased” and a  portion of our present literally
 inserted into the Phantom Earth time line.  Portions of Earth’s Planetary Shields under 
 Meajhé Zone  protection would be destabilized under a D-6 Planetary Hallah Phase Merk-
   aba Vehicle, and what remained of Earth would be heading for rapid pole shift  in 2012.          
  The Labyrinth Group of the Ancient Arrow Wingmakers project have no idea that
they are being deceived into creating the very technology that could lead to the 
destruction of Human civilization in 2011 . (Wake up guys—you’ve been taken for  a 
ride!).The people involved with the Labyrinth Group and associated organizations have   
been convinced  by the Nephilim “Corteum,” (they don’t even know they are Nephilim)     
that   only by developing the Corteum’s “BeaST” can Earth be protected from ET invasion.                             
The Labyrinth Group was told that a “big, bad invader race”9 is planning to invade Earth        
in 2011 and that the Corteum “BST weapon” is the only way to prevent this invasion.
 The UIR Corteum need the Labyrinth Group to create this technology for them,  as the
 Corteum cannot access the earthly scientific facilities, resources or geographical positions 
 needed to assemble the tactile components of the BeaST weapon. It is the Corteum
 themselves, and their recent allies of the UIR, that are intending to invade in 2011 ; 
 their rebel Omicron-Drakonian adversaries are intending a counter-invasion in hope of 
 preve nting UIR/Corteum victory.    
             The “Wingmakers Ancient Arrow” archeological site does not belong to the Lab-
 yrinth Group, or to the Corteum.   It belongs to a group of Emerald Covenant Angelic
  Human Races  from the Interdimensional Association of Free Worlds  in the 6520 AD 
 time period and to the Elohei-Elohim Founders , who long ago buried “time capsule trea-
 sures”  in this region specifically for discovery in this time.10 The Elohei-Elohim have 
 approached the Labyrinth Group with invitation to the Emerald Covenant, but the Laby-
 rinth Group refused when the Elohei-Elohim explained the non-violent solution  to the 
 pending UIR invasion. The Labyrinth Group also knows that the “Central Race” Elohei 
 and Angelic Humans will not support their efforts of creating the BeaST weapon , but the
 Corteum have convinced the Labyrinth Group that the invasion cannot be prevented using 
 peaceful methods. The Corteum and UIR are very interested in the Ancient Arrow site, as 
 hidden within this area is the very tool by which Emerald Covenant nations can prevent
 the 2011 UIR/Corteum Invasion.

UIR,  “Wingmakers,” the Labyrinth Weapon and 2011
An ancient device called a “Signet Shield” is buried in the area of the Wingmakers  
Ancient Arrow site, under GA Eieyani sonic-force field protection. The Signet (“Star  
Gate”) Shield disc is one of a set of 12 Signet Shields given to the Human Cloister Race  
Guardians of Earth over 200,000 years ago, by the Maharajhi of Sirius B, on behalf of the  
Elohei-Elohim Emerald Covenant Founders. The 12 Shields are manual activation/control  
devices for Earth’s 12 Star Gates, which can be put into use by combining them with their  
12 corresponding Emerald Covenant CDT-Plate disc activators.11 The Wingmakers site in  
New Mexico has been the storage place for Signet Shield-6, since the device was removed  
from Cue Site-6 in India in 5,900 BC, when the Rama races endured direct aerial assault  
from the Marduke-Dramin-Anunnaki and Centaur group during the Centuarian Invasion  
period. Signet Shield-6, and its corresponding SG/Cue-Site-6, is the Emerald Covenant  
“Trump Card” in this Final Con ﬂict drama. Signet Shield-6, SG/Cue Site-6 and the D-12  
Halls of Amoera Passage, in conjunction with three other Signet Shields/SGs/Cue Sites and  
Masters Planetary Templar Mechanics, will be used in 2011 to protect Earth and the Bridge  
Zone Project from UIR invasion during the Meajhe Zone weak period. GA anticipates a  
successful passage through the potential UIR invasion of 2011.

If we make it this far in Plan A and "fix the problem," the forces of peace , love
and genuine Christos enlightenment are likely to achieve final 2012 victory on
Earth and in this Time Matrix.________________________________________________________________________
    The Wingmakers “Music discs,” CD translations of which are presently promoted  
via mainstream distribution networks, were not originally part of the GA/Emerald Cov-  
enant Founders “time capsule.” These musical subliminal-command encryption pro-  
grams were provided by the Corteum and added to the Ancient Arrow site “finds,” as 
were certain pieces of Corteum artwork containing bio-stimulus mathematical codes,  
and a set of history recorder discs that have yet to be unearthed containing falsified  
Nephilim/Human history.
The real Wingmakers history and musical recorder-discs, smaller versions of the  
CDT-Plates, were placed in 5,900 BC, and are still in various protected regions of the  
GA Wingmakers site. Discovery of these true Human Race history Records, along with  
other such “GA Time Capsules” placed around the globe, will be permitted by the  
Founders between 2013-2017, as part of GA identity validation just prior to Emerald  
Covenant nation mass contact. The Corteum music and art selections are ‘Trojan  
Horse” technologies intended to affect the function of the DNA Template, creating the 
emotional experience of “calm, bliss and spontaneous cognition” via subtle biochemical/  
neurotransmitter/brainwave direction, while simultaneously blocking natural Pineal  
Gland and DNA Template 12-Code activation. These technologies can, however, be  
enjoyed without detrimental effect, if the Temporary Personal D-12 Maharic Seal Tech-  
nique (see page 499) is used prior to listening or viewing. The D-12 sub-harmonics of the  
natural Maharic Seal will block detrimental portions of the subliminal sound/light pro-  
grams from activating in the DNA Template. The Wingmakers Art Work is a combina-  
tion of Angelic Human visual/bio-stimulus images, with select pieces of Corteum  
control-program images mixed in among the Angelic Human artwork. One can detect  
the subtle difference in frequency between “healthful” Angelic Human images and  
“repressive” Nephilim/Corteum Intruder ET images by using the Maharic Seal Tech-  
nique, then sensing the energy signature behind the image. A deep, low, rumbling “ULF  
background cyclic vibration pulse” can be easily sensed in the Corteum images. Angelic  
Human images will not have this ULF “Phantom under-pulse,” but rather, each image  
will carry a set of three subtle UHF “inner sound tones” that are “frequency keyed” to  
12th-sub-frequency band of D-6 and the 6th-DNA Strand Template. Angelic Human  
Wingmaker images were designed to frequency-trigger progressive activation of Human  
and Indigo DNA Strand Templates 4-5-6, to accelerate Pineal Gland and DNA Tem-  
plate 12-Code activation.

  Crisis Intervention Expedited Amenti Opening Schedule
    36.  2012 Dec:  Meajhe-Trion Separation, Christos Realignment and Emerald Covenant
Mass Contact . The Final Con ﬂict drama of the 2000-2017 SAC will reach its conclu-
sion in 2012. The two bi-polarized segments of Earth’s particle base, the Trion Zones  
and the Meajhé Zones , that were held in suspension within the Trion/Meajhé Field
Buffer Blanket begin their final separation . Through the Indigo Children Planetary
Templar Security Team, the GA will release specific information on Meajhé Zone safe 
areas, urging populations to remove into these areas before Dec 2012. Trion Zone
areas will undergo regional Earth Changes  during 2012, as the final phase of the
Christos Realignment Mission completes in 2012. In early Dec 2012 , the frequencies
of the final Stellar Activations /Stellar Wave Infusions will begin. Meajhé Zones  of 
Earth will remain in the 4.25 Trion Buffer Bubble, as the suspended frequencies of the 
D7/D8 Gold Wave Infusion/ Arcturian Activation  that began in Aug-Sept 2002,
complete  activation in Earth’s grids. Completion of the Arcturian Activation will be 
rapidly followed by release of the suspended frequencies of the D8/D9 Silver Wave 
Infusion  and Orion Activation , and the D9/D10 Blue-Black Liquid Light Wave
Infusion and Andromeda Activation (original schedule 2017) . As the Arcturian, 
Orion and Andromeda Activations complete, the Trion Zone  areas will begin their 
cycle of localized Earth Changes that will mark the passage of unsecured areas of
Earth’s Planetary Shields into merger with the Phantom Matrix time line.  Portions of 
Earth territories under Meajhé Zone / Quatra Phase Merkaba protection will begin
their shift into full merger with the Inner Earth Bridge Zone time continuum.  In the
original Amenti Ascension Schedule, due to terms of the 1992 Pleiadian-Sirian 
Agreements, the final phase of the Founders’ Christos Realignment Mission was not 
due for completion until the 4230  end of our present continuum cycle. Due to the 
Anunnaki/Anu-Elohim defection and nullification of the Pleiadian-Sirian Agree-
ments and UIR War Edict, the Emerald Covenant Founders will now complete the 
   Christos Realignment Mission , as they had attempted to do during the failed SAC of 
22,326 BC.  The Founders intended to complete the Christos Realignment Mission 
since that time long ago, until compromising their agenda to accommodate the
potentialities of peace  held within the 1992 Pleiadian-Sirian Agreements.
    37.  Dec 21, 2012 : This is the date the Founders have chosen for fulfillment of the Chris-
         tos Realignment Mission .  This date now translated into our contemporary calendar 
    from the ancient Lemurian/Mu’a Founders calendar system, was  not recently chosen.  
    This date was chosen for completion of the Christos Realignment Mission in 22,326 
    BC , by the Emerald Covenant Elohei-Elohim Founders, Eieyani, Azurite, Maharajhi 
      and Angelic Human races, when the SAC of that Lemurian/Atlantian time period
         failed due to Anunnaki invasion.  The date was chosen through mechanics of inter-
           time physics; the point in “future time” that we now identify as Dec 21, 2012, marked 
            a point   within   the 2000-2017 SAC in which planetary positions would be in  the  most 
                                appropriate alignment to complete full , Permanent Level-12 Planetary Maharic
         Seal.  Throughout our recorded history this date was known by various ancient cul-
         tures as the time of the “ Great Cleansing”  or “The End of Time”, as illustrated for us 
           today in the ancient Mayan Calendar .            ________________________________________________________________________                          
                        On Dec 21, 2012, the GA will finally be able to fulfill their originally
                                    intended mission of setting Earth, and this Time Matrix, 
                                                        free from Fallen Angelic terrorism.           _________________________________________________________________       
     
     On this date, the Emerald Covenant Founders races will release the Universal SC 
Seals on Universal SG-12 in our Time Matrix, the Inner Earth Time Matrix and the 
Trans-Harmonic Meajhé Time Matrix, fully linking the three Time Matrixes, the " Divine 
Cosmic Trinity ," together. While remaining in the Bridge Zone time continuum and 
Trion/Meajhé Field Buffer Blanket, Earth will receive three additional Stellar Wave 
Infusions/ Transmutative Stellar Activations on this day . The D10/D11 Silver-Black 
Liquid Light Infusion  and D- 10 Lyra-Vega Activation , the D11/D12 Pale Silver Mah-
arata “Christos”  Liquid Light Infusion  and D-11 Lyra-Aveyon Activation , and the long-
awaited D-12/Primal Light Field “Rainbow Ray”  Infusion  and D-12 Lyra- Aramatena  
Activation.  D-12 Lyra-Aramatena, home of Universal SG-12 in our Time Matrix, is the

          Density-4, D-12 Pre-matter Hydroplasmic Liquid Light " Christos Divine Blueprint " of 
           the Earth-Tara-Gaia System. The "Shield of Aramatena," as this scalar template is called,
          is also the D-12 Pre-matter Universal Divine Blueprint,  or “Universal Christos”, for all
         intergalactic systems in the 12 dimensions of Densities-1 through 4 in our Time Matrix. 
    
                     Earth    will enter  the "Christed" state of   D-12 Mahunta Merkaba  on Dec 21, 2012;
          the Halls of Amenti    Star Gates and 12 Star Gates  of Earth’s Templar will remain per-
         petually open  after this point, and Emerald Covenant races will begin preparation for a 
         long overdue re-introduction. Earth’s SGs and Seven Primary V ortices will not enter a 
           closing cycle, as they would have done in the original Amenti Ascension program. As the
            Permanent Level-12 D-12 Planetary Maharic Seal  activates in the Planetary Shields of 
        Earth-T ara-Gaia, the scalar-wave templates of our Time Matrix and those of Phantom 
           Matrix will naturally and permanently separate.

                    The Universes in our Time Matrix will begin the victory celebration  they have  
                    awaited 250 billion years,  since formation of the Phantom Matrix during  the  
                                                        Founders Lyran-Elohim WarS.               _______________________________________________________________           
                                     Earth races will soon afterward be prepared for a visit from the Inner Earth Eieyani , 
         Sirius B Maharaji, Azurite, Aethien and Serres Emerald Covenant races , who will
           make contact on behalf of the Founders, to invite Earth’s peoples into the Emerald Cove-
         nant. Physical Mass Contact with Emerald Covenant nations is scheduled for 2017
            The UIR will be unable to use their weapons technologies, or infiltrate Earth’s Halls of 
           Amenti SG system once Earth is under full Permanent Level-12 Planetary Maharic Seal/
        D-12 Mahunta Phase Merkaba. Fallen Angelic and Illuminati races that do not engage 
        DNA Bio-Regenesis will be unable to biologically withstand Earth’s environment. 
        The GA  will of fer escorted evacuation to quarantined healing facilities in the Sirius star sys-
        tem in this Time Matrix to Fallen Angelic/Illuminati races that remain in this Time 
          Matrix. Remaining Human and Indigo populations will progress in DNA reverse-muta-
